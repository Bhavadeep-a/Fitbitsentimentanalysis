"I got this for my birthday and I have been using about a month now.  This is my first Fitbit so I can't really compare to the other models but as an individual product it is great.I bought it to encourage me to walk more and have been using it for my couch 2 5k runs, I find it seems fairly accurate and the automatic workout sensor is very cool although it did get it wrong one time and thought I was on the eliptical when I was actually running lol! but every other time it has been correct in sensing whether I am running or walking.The sleep function is very cool and seems to be accurate, I find it interesting to check each morning!The app is great although at times I can have trouble SYNCing it to my watch, it always resolves after I turn off bluetooth and reconnect but can get a bit annoying.  The app is great though, you can find more in depth information about your sleep cycles, your steps, distance you've walked, your workouts and more, you can track your period and symptoms and it will predict when you are next due on, you can also track your birth conrol pills etc.  I you wish you can track your calories and the food you've eaten or the water you have dank.  There is a community section and you can add your friends to motivate and support each other which is very nice.  There are many apps to choose from, there are apps for kegel exercises, for meditation/mindfulness, for toothbrushing etc.There is a premium function but I have not bought it, through this you have access to workouts etc but for me personally I wasn't willing to pay for it from the reviews I read it seemed overpriced.  Another thing I have read is aparently the tend to break if you use them in water so be careful of that..I personally take it off to shower etc as to me it's not worth the risk.  I like to use spotify through my watch when running/walking as it makes it so much easier to skip through songs rather than pulling my whole phone out!Overall I am very happy with the watch, it looks great, I got the pink colour and I love it! It looks smart and goes with every outfit and it doubles up as a nice accessory as well as being functional.  It definitely motivates me to keep active and I love all the additional apps and functions, I would recommend it!",5.0
I upgraded my Fitbit HR to this version. Easy to install and a lot more advanced than my last one. More features and clear screen. Very happy with this buy.,5.0
"As a gym person I quite like it! It's not as smart as Apple watch but it's smart enough to help you deal with few things while on the go. Great synch with fitness Pal, no problem with iPhone synch so far. Battery is a winner I got it yesterday afternoon with 60% battery with a set up, full use of the features as I was playing around it has 55% today! I can't be more happy:) great sleep tracking, water intake, women health:) if you have a Revolut card great synch with contactless payments:)Events from Apple calendar pop up on the screen too! Sleek look and very very soft strap-super comfy even when sleeping:)So far so good!",5.0
Most of the features are useless.Cannot use to pay with contactless as only A couple of banks in UK are included.Cannot use for music as it won’t connect toDeezer even though I had to pay for a Deezer account and paired it.  I do not use iTunes so that app is useless.Could not get Alexa to work.Doesn’t show details of sleep quality unless you pay for the Premium account and I feel it’s a cheek to have to pay an extra subscription to use when the watch itself is expensive.Pros: Alarm is good and wakes up with vibration.I like the Relaxation app.Variety of watch faces to choose from.But overall unimpressed as this really is just an expensive watch with a step counter.  Now going to return it and stick with my cheaper step counter which has better features for a fraction of the price.,2.0
"I love my new watch. I have had a few Fitbits before but changed to a Samsung tracker for better integration with my phone. One thing I noticed very quickly, though, was that it wasn't tracking steps very accurately. This tracks every single step I take. If I walk 100 steps it counts 100 steps, whether I'm holding a bag (or motorbike helmet) or have my hands in my pockets. These were two things that seem to confuse the Samsung watch. The only bad point is that Fitbit seems to give me a few hundred extra steps a day when I ride the motorbike. The heart rate always seems a little high too, otherwise the watch is accurate.The app sometimes seems to struggle to sync with the watch, occasionally causing problems with passing notifications from the phone to the watch. The app needs a general update and ""sort out"" overall in my opinion. The food tracking is brilliant, with a HUGE catalogue of foods available to enter with just a barcode. If we were allowed to enter our own foods with a barcode (for the odd missing item) it would be a lot better still. Samsung's app and phone connection is 100 times better. Samsung also offer LOTS of free excercise plans and fitness tips, Fitbit have chosen to make these features ""Premium"" which is the very worst thing about Fitbit in general. This is the only way that Samsung is better than Fitbit.The watch looks lovely. I really love looking at it and it feels very comfortable 24 hours a day. The finish seems of a very high quality. This one of the reasons I chose this over other Fitbit models.The watch functions well as a fitness tracker, watch and calendar. The touch screen looks great and feels great to use. This watch motivates me to keep moving all day, helping me get fitter and lose a little weight.Overall this is the best watch I've ever owned and it is an absolute bargain.Update, 4 months with the watch I have lost 2 stone. Most importantly I have lost a lot of body fat and gained muscle. This was down to tracking the food on the app and keeping below the calories I had burned. I wasn't fat and haven't worked hard for this but having everything in one app has helped me realise what I was doing badly!",5.0
"Upgraded from son’s old Blaze (he went Apple) Always been a fan of the sleep tracking on Fitbit, which is the same as the old Blaze, due to the fact it uses the same App on your smart phone. The exception is battery life it’s simply excellent, without using the always on face, I’m getting about 5 days of charge, compared to Blaze which needed charging every morning whilst showering. (My sons Apple Watch S3 is on charge every night....Hah!) haven’t checked out all the apps yet, but really loving the sleeker design, the fact I can wear in the pool or shower, don’t need to remember press the ‘water proofing’ button as you do on Apple S3 Watch, just wear it like it’s a watch! The mobile app is clear, there aren’t as many apps as on a Apple to download- but that means it’s simple to use, easy to get the hang of, and quite frankly EXTREMELY GOOD VALUE at its price point.  If you’re not a die hard Apple fan and value the pennies in your pocket, the Versa 2 is your perfect fitness tracker!",5.0
Hi I had to return this item as it wouldn't download to my phone and still waiting for a refund,1.0
"I bought it during lockdown to encourage me to move more. I really wanted to like it - not only as the red gold and purple design appealed to me - but I'm utterly underwhelmed to say it politely!First of all it comes without any instruction manual at all and is very difficult to set up if you haven't owned one before. The screen is much smaller as expected from pictures and the black frame around display makes it even smaller which makes small writing difficult to read. Not very accurate either as I compared with GPS from my phone. This device is also more suitable for American Market as most of the apps are not supported in the UK, so useless! On top of an already expensive watch you have to pay nearly £10 per months to access premium services which puts me off most. You can buy a new smartwatch for the money you spend on premium services paid for a year!Watch itself is made from cheap plastic and charger style is fiddly if you want to use bumper case for screen protection as you have to remove it every time you want to charge it. Battery life is poor too (about 2 to 3 days) and I didn't even use always on display!Only pros for me:- nice clear Amoled display- fairly accurate sleep tracker- I liked the square screen design, just too small for me- it comes with 2 straps to fit every wrist and straps didn't irritated my sensitive skin- nice colour scheme - red gold with purple strap- lightweight as made from plasticTo sum it up: I don't understand the hype about fitbit products at all and returned it after a week for full refund.They are just cheaply made, overpriced basic pedometers for brand snobs and certainly not worth the money! You just pay for the brand and not quality which makes it very bad value for money! In fact my first experience with fitbit was so bad that I would not even try another product of this brand.I bought a Huawei GT2e (new model) instead for less than £100 while on offer which is superior to the fitbit versa 2! Bigger Amoled display in metal case, not plastic! Integrated GPS and all services are free incl a large range of watch faces. Not to mention a battery life of about 10 days! This is what I call quality and value for money! And even my gadget loving husband was so impressed that he ordered one for himself today, although he said he didn't want or need one! This says it all, lol.",1.0
"Great product let down by some slightly iffy syncing from time to time. Good battery life and good tracking as long as you don't expect miracles.  Good notifications from watts app etc.  Don't' really know why you would waste your money on an iWatch etc when you can get this. It would be nice if they did some work on the phone app though so you could more detailed heart rate tracking, for instance I have sleep apnea so being able to see minute by minute heart rate during the night would be useful but as it is you just see the whole day as a graph.",4.0
"Bought this in August 2019, it had been great. I connected it to Strava and used it to track my runs. Then last year I started cycling so I've been using it for that and tracking my steps aswell. That's all I wanted it for, not interested in sleep tracking or anything else really... Just tracking and keeping an eye on how many miles I've done during a ride and also my heart rate. The watch looks great and I'm still using the original strap and there's no scratches on it despite bashing it a few times. The battery still lasts 3 days too, even after using it for workouts.Issues -In the past month I've started to encounter problems with the device and it's been really unreliable. It wouldn't connect to Bluetooth, kept saying pairing rejected, and it kept losing my GPS signal which is a pain, and not syncing. I did a 16 mile bike ride today and it only tracked 3 miles of it. This is after following all the problem solving steps on the Fitbit website and speaking with customer service and spending 4 hours messing with it and eventually doing a factory reset. I thought that had solved the issues but it is just too unreliable for me now. I'm going to sell it and try the Versa 3 in hope that it will work but I'm also not too convinced that it won't fail at some point in future. It's a shame as I like Fitbit and the style of watch and interface but if I experience issues again then I won't be buying a Fitbit device in future.",3.0
"Firstly I do really like the look of the watch.  It does resemble an apple watch in many ways and I really cant fault the build quality.  The rose gold metal looks classy and the whole thing feels like a quality bit of kit that I was happy to wear.I'd upgraded from a much cheaper Huawei band, expecting a huge improvement, but other than a few unnecessary bells and whistles, I'm not sure I got it.Firstly, the display.  Brilliant to have a wide choice of downloadable faces.  However using the always on display drains the battery in just over a day. Not using always on is an option, but unlike previous bands, this seems to need a button press to view, rather than turning the wrist.  A small, but annoying point.Alexa built in is also unnecessary and seems quite gimmicky.Was excited to be able to control Spotify from the watch, but the reaction time on this is slow and frustrating.Step counting seems fairly accurate.  However I was disappointed to find that the watch has no in built GPS (unlike my far cheaper Huawei) and relies on connecting to your phone GPS, so no maps of running/walking routes available post workout.The last straw for me has been that after a few weeks of use, it seems to be struggling to maintain connection/sync with my phone.  Reluctantly I'm sending it back and will stick to the Huawei!",2.0
"Buyer beware:1. This Fitbit does not fully support the Windows 10 Fitbit app.  Android and IOS are supported, but will often tell you to connect the device to ""your computer"" to performa certain tasks.2. There is no obvious way to transfer your own music to the device storage, although this is a key selling point.3. No native Spotify.  The Spotify app only allows you to control playback from a phone--undermining the ""leave the phone at home"" selling point4.  Deezer is supported offline but ineptly:  the app only shows a subset of your Deezer playlists, and if the one you want to run with is not showing the only way to access it it to delete other playlists until it appears.5. Connectivity and synching are fiddly and uncertain:  some functions only work while charging--but the error messages do not inform the user of the need to connect the device to the charging cradle.6.  No Google Assistant: although Spotify is now owned by Google, the phone only offers Alexa.7. Online help ""community"" will sometimes offer user-generated workarounds, the official response is either to misunderstand the question, ignore it altogether...or shrug.This appears--on paper-- to be a superb piece of hardware. But it desperately needs a complete revamp of the firmware and mobile and desktop apps. If Google are serious about this acquisition they need to seriously look at the programming talent involved in the project.",1.0
"I was always a Fitbit fan,  having bought half a dozen devices over the years, but Fitbit has now completely devalued the entire product range by replacing the excellent summary of the actual time spent asleep with the risible ""sleep score"".  Don't be fooled, this change is a cynical and greedy ploy by Fitbit to get people to upgrade to the premium service which involves paying a monthly subscription fee for something that used to be free. There are many complaints about this change on the Internet and for me this is a complete stopper to using Fitbit going forward.  I'm now waiting for Apple to build in a decent sleep app at which point I will jump ship to the Apple watch.",1.0
"I got this as a gift.It stopped working after 1 week of use. Really disappointed with the product, but the worst part was amazon's customer service - I was offered a repair (for a watch that I've paid nearly 200 pounds). When ai requested a new watch I was told to contact Fitbit by myself and was sent contact form for fitbit.I've bought the watch fr amazon, so I am expecting to have a solution from amazon, not having 5o contact fitbit by myself.Shocking.",1.0
"Well, I tested the  Apple serie 5 Watch for a week (returned!)  just before purchasing this one. In terms of technical promises they are pretty similar this one is even better because it has the sleep tracking.Few different things though that makes Apple a bit more in advance than others is the look.1 - In terms of esthetics this watch is not good at all, so men will like it :(  the full screen is not covered when showing the time, there is a black sort of square around that disturbs me a lot. Only If you buy third party sellers some background watches for Fitbit, maybe you will be lucky to have a full screen covered.2- the main button is on the left side. VERY ANNOYING especially If you wear the watch on the left wrist. The button should have been on the right side (more practical) Apple Watch lets you do that by changing your wrist bands if necessary (an other point for them but their price is crazy high)3- The app is confusing. the user is mostly lost at the beginning and can't start a workout without knowing the watch well before hand! :(4- finally price is still a bit high even though it's half price of an Apple Watch there are many more watches on the market under 50 £ offering same features5- Alexa on my testing watch was not talking, there is no speaker on the phone, it just writes the info, I always need glasses to read, very annoying.",2.0
"I've been a long-standing Pebble Time wearer, but wanted something a bit more up-to-date, and was interested in having heart rate measurement. Battery life is great - easily 5 days with constant use, and only an hour or two to charge back up. I need to have to my phone on me anyway during walks/runs etc. so the Connected GPS is fine for me. The app is packed full of information, although I will say the interface is a bit confusing - just try tapping on everything and there's often more data hidden behind. I'm finding the calorie budget and food logging functionality really useful and have lost a couple of pounds after only a couple of weeks. The heart rate and sleep tracking has proved more interesting than I was expecting. Screen visibility is fine indoors, outdoors. It's a bit plasticky to be honest, but I'm not really worried about the looks anyway. Notifications work well, and give you ability to clear them from the watch, and for some apps delete, open on phone etc. (I'm on Android). There are lots of guided workouts and things from the phone app that I haven't tried yet, but my free trial of Fitbit Premium hasn't convinced me it's worth £9.99 a month yet. Connectivity has been absolutely fine on a Pixel 3a (Android 10). Love the single button on the left side of the watch (I'm right-handed) - simplifies interface, and means it doesn't get accidentally pressed during press-ups, handstands etc. It's not a computing powerhouse like the Galaxy Watch Active or Fossil Wear watches in terms of app choice etc. but I personally don't want to play around with apps on a tiny screen, and not having to charge every day is the absolute clincher for me - I just don't want to find myself away from home unexpectedly for example, with a dead watch because I didn't charge it yesterday. In terms of accuracy, it definitely has a tendency to record movements incorrecly as steps - I'm a drummer, and have to take it off if I'm practicing/playing otherwise I add thousands of extra steps! However, overallI'm very impressed.",5.0
Positives:It is very stylish looking with an extra strap.It has lots of good features including sleep score.The charge lasts quite a while.There is challenges to keep you motivated and mindfullness programs which are great with the covid19 situation.The price is reasonable.Notifies me of messages and emails and allows me to send short responses from the watch.Mobile app is easy to use.Negatives:The accuracy is not great. It doesnt count me going up flights of stairs in my home.It does not have an oximeter.The clock faces have to be purchased with money.Certain apps need premium membership.It doesnt always read heart rate if you have arm/wrist tattoos.Overall its a good watch though. Happy with it and everything it does. Of course there are negatives but the price is reasonable.,5.0
"Everything about the watch is spot on (accurate sleep tracking, app notifications, calls, exercise reminders) except for the steps counter! I’m not sure how much it over estimates my steps (maybe by 50% or more); it is super sensitive that even when driving fitbit counts the wrist movement as steps. Also going to the toilet at night records a whopping 60 steps when it’s probably just 20 steps back and forth to my room. 😅I have a relatively small wrist so I got worried when I bought versa 2 but upon wearing it, I realised it isn’t as big as it looks like. I got this as a present to my sister and seeing how it works made me buy one for myself as well. I like how they have different colours to choose from. The straps are easy to remove so you can change them whenever you want. ❤️😊",4.0
"The Fitbit Versa 2 is a great watch for anyone wanting to get their fitness to the next level. The watch is big but it still looks great on a tiny wrist and is comfortable to wear. It is waterproof (had an accident on day 1!) but it is not what I would call burgundy! If like me you think burgundy as more of a red shade, this watch in burgundy colour is purple! Still beautiful but the image colour is accurate, it's more purple than red. But that is really the only bad thing I have to say about this!The measurements are likely not highly accurate but that is true for any smart watch, take the numbers as general trends not exact! Very happy with it and nice to see that Fitbit made app improvements.",5.0
"Looks great, comfy to wear, very reasonably priced. As a basic watch it functions well. If you turn the always on display off its last just over a week but with always on its about 2 days. The always on display is poor, you cant see it a lot of the time and its different to the clock faces you choose. The sleep track is excellent that’s i purchased the Versa 2. The other functions like heart rate are shocking. Doing a HITT workout Where my heart heart was near its max my heart rate on the Versa is showing around 130 lol. If you want a basic smart watch with is excellent for sleep tracking and has good battery life this is your watch. I also order the charge 4 but sent it back. Again with the charge 4 the heart rate is a joke. I found the Versa 2 more comfy to wear and think the charge 4 looks like a kids watch. Both very similar but the charge 4 is fiddly to use where the Versa 2 is easy.",4.0
"I love Fitbits as they always encourage me to get up and drink more water, to get better quality sleep and to eat healthier. Having a constant reminder on your wrist is the perfect way to stay active.Charges really quickly and holds its charge for about four or five days depending on how much you use it.I love that it's water proof - I rinse mine off every time I have a shower as dead skin tends to rub off into it when wearing all the time. Very easy to clean and comfortable to wear.Love this colour the most!!Sleep monitoring skill is very interesting and some of the new clock faces are really inventive. I have steps as my main goal because once I've accomplished that I tend to have already completed the others in the process!Had some trouble updating it at first but I spoke to someone on webchat and it was sorted very quickly - great customer service.Anyway, I love it and I highly recommend.",5.0
"It is beautiful, I bought it on sale and for the price it is what I wanted. A digital watch that does other things besides tell the time.It is great for walking, running, hiking and only a little bit off counting steps. It is a bit useless for biking as it can't tell you the distance but it will tell you calories, heart rate and even the speed of your bike ride. The distance travelled will not be logged correctly though and it can't be edited afterwards. I have looked for fixes on forums and this problem has been brought up at least a year ago and it is not fixed. I do a daily trip of 7km but it only logs 1.3km on average. Some people have mentioned that it will even show their route on the map but the total value isn't correctly logged.It loses pairing very often as well. I'm not sure why... but I simply add a new versa 2 when it stops sync. So I've added my versa about once every 2 weeks. It is a bit of a pain but no data is lost by simply replacing it on the app. It is a gorgeous piece but adding new faces to it can be a long boring process...Overall I would buy it again probably as the competition isn't priced as well and the watches aren't as pretty.If you want a smartwatch for more casual purposes like logging your workouts, tracking your sleep, having an idea of your daily steps (it comes with several features that I don't use but you might want like food log, water intake, weight tracking) then I would recomment it for you.It is very customizable, you can change the amount of calories you wish to reach daily, the amount of steps, hours of sleep, etc. It is all done through the app or dashboard (on the website).",4.0
"My partner and I have used FitBit for years and love the step tracking, sleep tracking and the layout etc of the App. However after the disappointment of this product my partner has now switched to Garmin.The Versa 2 is a very nice looking watch but please keep your eyes open read the specs carefully and all the reviews.Liked:Nice design, Interchangeable straps, bright clear straps.Disliked:Alexa functionality was a key advertising tool, applications are very minimal, and actually was never used.Spotify account kept logging you out constantly, known issue with no resolution. Plus requires premium membership.Pay functionality is extremely limited and very few banks available.Screen glass is not robust, you must buy a screen protector.",2.0
"Sent back.The watch itself was great.The smart watch features were fantastic.It has an attractive sleek design that doesn't sit too proud on the wrist.The issue was the gps.My other half wanted an upgrade from his tomtom - he wanted a heart rate monitor and I thought some smart features would make it a great Christmas present.We were aware the GPS was linked to the phone rather than having its own strand alone gps in the watch - fine as my partner runs with his phone all the time anyway. What was disappointing is the GPS is used to create a pretty map of where he's been and that seemed to be all. The distance he ran was worked out based on his stride length and number of steps. This led to his usual 5km run being measured at a little over half this distance!! Granted we hadn't set up his stride length, but we were also very aware his stride length would change depending on his pace. If he 'ran' with me - I'm incredibly slow - or if he sprinted to pass his navy set fitness times or beating himself in 10ks.We bought this watch primarily for running and the smart features were extra. It is not suitable for this if you're interested in accurately tracking your runs. We switched to a Garmin and he loves it.If however you want an attractive smart watch with some health tracking features it's great!!",3.0
"Really underwhelmed with this device. Heart rate tracker is spotty at best, I followed all the advice but it still drops from 'peak' to 'fatburn' in an instant, and then back whilst working out. Not really what I wanted, and it is often wildly out against any piece of equipment I use in the gym with a HR monitor. The only advice fitbit were able to give me was to change the positioning, which I did and still have this issue.There is no functionality for fitbit pay in the UK unless you bank with Santander or a few other banks I had never heard of.If you want more in depth sleep tracking, and a few other features you need to pay for fitbit premium, another added cost on top of an already expensive watch.Very few apps available, no functionality for anything like amazon music (despite having an inbuilt Alexa).Voice recognition for replying to messages is TERRIBLE and unusable.I have a fitbit in Stone, and its purple. It looks grey ish on the website but its definitely purple. Within a month the colour was rubbing off the buckle on the strap too so thats not good. The silicon strap is ugly, and although you can buy third party straps, its very tricky to swap them over and not really worth the hassle.I enjoy the activity tracking, heart rate (when it works) and the screen on the watch is of good quality, but this falls so far short of what I thought it was going to be.In my opinion, save yourself a lot of money and avoid, or purchase a smartwatch.",2.0
"I bought this for my wife who hates watches, and said she did not want a fittness/smartwatches. My main reason for getting this for her is she has tachycardia, I thought it would be easier to keep track of her heart rate. Getting the weekly report sent straight to her phone.We set it up very easily. The app was great. She put it on and finds it very comfortable. She loves it. Customising all her goals, lady calendars, and Alexa. She loves asking it all sort of questions.The steps accuracy is great, sleep cycles are great and easy to record. All round great so far.",5.0
"Easy to use. Seems to pick up the steps accurately. Heart rate again is accurate against my blood pressure monitor. I walk and like the GPS maps of where I have been. Steps taken , heart rate and calories burned. I also do Yoga which it can’t really track other than heart rate. The watch encourages me to move and  push my heart rate up.I have lost around half a stone and my blood pressure has decreased. All good.",5.0
"Great item until it became faulty after 10 months? I had a right hassle sending it back for repair and having it returned. When it did arrive back it wasn't the watch i sent for repair? It was a different colour (not great) and it arrived in flimsy plastic pouches and not the original packaging/box i sent it for repair in? Not only have i now got an item in a totally different colour from the one i purchased, i don't have any of the original packaging and i never got any explanation as to what was wrong with my item and why i was sent a different replacement? Very shoddy and unprofessional.",5.0
"I'm having a lot of fun with this. Previously I've used basic trackers but the upgrade has been worth it. As a fitness tracker the features are very useful. I didn't think I was interested in the sleep tracking but have found it really informative. I find the tracker easy to use and am making the most of the app and the motivation that comes with it. The screen is great and I find I can read it in bright sunlight.  As a first time smart watch user, a stand out moment for me was when I was busy painting furniture, I was able to read and reply to a text using my voice, without finding my phone- now that's convenient. The Alexa feature is good for basic requests like the weather. The colour is gorgeous and the strap is very comfortable and easy to clean. There is a lot I still haven't tried; the music storage, the Spotify control, the work outs. I got this on offer (£155) and so far I'm getting a lot for my money.",5.0
"Bought this a few days ago (13th January 2020) and I've been extremely disappointed so far. I've seen reviews saying ""this is a good watch for your first smart watch"" which doesn't give me much hope for the future of smart watches. Connection issues with bluetooth and internet, when my phone has no problem with either, is concerning. Right now this watch is in alpha/beta meaning it should NOT have been released for consumers and as far as I'm concerned, Fitbit have ripped people off. People have been writing reviews in September about the connection issues and it's now midway through January, 4 months without any update, and all the troubleshooting ""advice"" they give you suggests that it's a problem on your end. To cut a long story short, I'm gonna return and get a refund and shop around for a different watch. On the Fitbit fitness tracking side of things its okay, does the job in that department but I didn't pay full price for half the package.  Was looking forward to using Fitbit too.",1.0
"I was really disappointed with this order if I’m honest. I liked the idea of being able to pay for things with my watch however I found out after it arrived that it basically doesn’t support any UK high street branch. If you are with HSBC, Virgin, Santander, Monzo, Yorkshire Bank, NatWest, Halifax  First Direct or nationwide you can forget paying for things on your watch - if you want that you really need an Apple Watch. Music - another disappointment, only supports Deezer (does anyone use this???) or Apple Music subscription. You can’t play your iTunes without downloading onto the watch from the computer (pain in the arse), Spotify or Amazon musics = nope not those either. The Alexa feature on it is clunky - you have to select Alexa from the top of the screen - so if your in the middle of any exercise, it’s basically pointless, it doesn’t have ‘always listening’. It doesn’t support any of the fitness apps you may actually want to use like Nike training club, instead you have to choose from the very limited, cheap apps that it has on its list which is very very very restrictive. And if your interested in your running, fitness and overall wellness- you would be 100 times better getting a Garmin. My brother In law got his Garmin two weeks after I got this and I’ll be honest, I was gutted when I saw how much better his was than mine and price wise he paid the same for his watch as I paid for mine. I’d have swapped it in an instant without a second through. Design wise - well it’s not the nicest looking watch is it? It looks cheap especially with the plastic straps that make it look like a child’s watch. Not really what I wanted when I wear it all day to my corporate job then go to a health club to workout. The app though is very simple to use, very clear and I do like the women’s health (period tracker) section which is an absolute God send when trying to plan weekends away around aunt flow. It’s not bad, if it was around the £50 mark, but when your spending the best part of £200 on a fitness watch you wear 24/7 I think there are much better options out on the market -",2.0
"I had a lot of problems setting the Versa 2 up with my phone (Pixel 3) which is on the compatible phones list.Once it was finally working it seemed to be good, i was getting notifications and it was tracking activity and sleep.The problems were when I'd try to sync with my phone, which on average once a day I would get 'device not found' on screen despite it being connected to Bluetooth. I turned power saving off for fitbit app and Bluetooth on my phone - but this problem persisted. I'd have to restart my phone to resync.I returned the watch as I didn't want to keep having to restart my phone and watch, and I'd miss out on notifications when they got disconnected. It's a shame because the look and features of the hardware really suited what I was looking for.",2.0
"Sent it back after a week, wouldn't stay connected and kept telling me I had to restart my phone to connect, notification would come though about 30% of the time, sleep tracker was off, step count didn't match my phone (by a few 1000 steps).Very basic smart watch/fitness tracker considering the price tag on it.Can only respond to messages with the pre listed responses and emojis, you can set up your own responses but only a couple of words, you can speak to respond to text but that's not very accurate and you have to talk loud for it to register.Only good thing I can say was it was nice and light to wear, even when sleeping and the strap didn't irritate at all.",1.0
"Update: I'm not sure what the strap is made of but it irritated my skin and I'm not very happy about that. It's great to have a smartwatch with great features but if becomes unwearable then what's the purpose?This is the first smartwatch I own and so far I'm really pleased with it. Firstly, the watch is very stylish, looks premium and is comfortable to wear. The strap itself is soft and very easy to adjust, whilst its AMOLED display makes it look and feel premium. I got the pink version which is easy to pair with all types of outfits as it's pastel/ not too bright. I also like that you're able to change its strap and already saw a few options to make it look more elegant if you wish to.Secondly, when you get inside the watch and its functionality, I really like the heart rate tracking option as I drink coffee and it's amazing to see what a big difference it makes. I also love that it tracks the quality of your sleep and it gives you a sleep score, I have been trying to go to bed on time every single night since I got it. Although I was concerned that I won't be able to sleep with the watch on, I've had no problems with it. I don't wear it whilst showering as I find that a bit odd and don't want to ruin it even though I know it's water resistant (that's what happens when you're not born with technology). But I do like that I can wear it when it's raining and not worry that it will get damaged. One other functionality I like is the alarm option, the watch vibrates on your wrist and you can choose the 'Smart Wake' option so that it doesn't affect the quality of your sleep. Plus you won't be waking up your partner if waking up at different times.What I don't like: The Wallet functionality doesn't work due to the type of debit card I hold, so I'd suggest checking which ones are supporting if this is a really big thing for you. I also got the Fitbit Premium app but I've never really used it as it seems the free version of the app works just fine. The charger itself is also not the best design but I like that it charges your watch super fast (it takes about 1 hour to fully recharge).",3.0
"This is one of the worse products I've ever seen in my life. I'm a software engineer and I bought this to help me managing my smart home which I've being building as a DIY for a couple of months, so I'm not completely layman on technology products. The setup is a completely nightmare, app loses track of % complete, watch doesn't start, app can't sync... After a couple of hours setting up I was able to sync it with app and tried to use the Alexa feature (which was the reason for me to buy it) It's a complete nightmare again. It loses connection with phone every 5 minutes and you need to open the app to sync it again (sometimes the sync progress stalls). It doesn't have a ""Find my phone"" feature and it can't connect to spotify or anything if not synched with phone (it asks for resync every 3~5 minutes).For it's price (163 pounds) I expected an amazing spaceship, but this is simply a fancy, expensive and terrible product around your wrist. Buy a Mi Smartband 4 instead. Much cheaper and doesn't try to trick you into having features it doesn't have (this have the features it promises but they don't work, so it's the same as not have).",1.0
"The watch is small enough to look good on my very slim wrists.  Other watches have always looked too big.  The display is really good and the ability to change the watch interface digitally is a nice touch.This is the first fitness watch I've owned that really encourages me to move more without annoying me.  I like that it automatically logs active minutes, the sleep assessment is really accurate and the heart rate monitor is pretty spot on but can take a second or two to catch up when you change exertion levels.  The only downfall is the calorie tracking database.  Compared with MFP, Fitbit still has a way to go and I find that the app can't recognise many foods or their barcodes.  I'd still recommend this watch though.",5.0
"Bought after much research. After 1 hour the ‘raise to wake’ became erratic, sometimes came on, sometimes not. Menus very small and fiddly hampered by the physical menu button being on the left. I wear a watch on my left hand and this is awkward to use my right thumb to press the button. The display cannot be rotated. I found the wristband to be too smooth, the watch slips around the wrist or is too tight. Nothing in between. Most third-party watch ‘faces’ cost to download. I also found that as the watch is always connected to the mobile app, my phone battery drains quicker. The GPS feature is quite useless, as the phone is always required to provide the signal, which means carrying 2 devices everywhere you go. I think Fitbit need to make some big improvements in design and functionality. Returned to Amazon within 24 hours of purchase.",1.0
"This watch was great when it first arrived; it was very accurate and all the apps were fab! However, after about a month or so the touchscreen just stopped working and it became impossible to use the watch. Tried restarting it which didn’t work and because the factory reset is in the settings of the watch, it can’t be accessed when the touch screen isn’t working so that wasn’t an option. When I looked in the Fitbit help page it seemed to be a common problem amongst this model with a lot of people and the Fitbit customer service was appalling. There was no help apart from “have you tried restarting it?” After I had already told them I had attempted restart! Amazon were great and sent me a full refund so no complaints there :) so just be warned if you decide to buy this watch!",1.0
"Very good product, fits well in my wrist and its barely noticeable, I sometimes forget I have it on until I check he time or my heart rate. For a while it used to synch up to my phone automatically but now I have to manually sync which is fine. The mobile app has some problems when sending messages to the watch as I have to reset the app each time to get my messages to come through. But overall I'm very pleased with this watch as it allows me to keep track of my fitness and eating/drinking habits.",5.0
"I had a Fitbit blaze previously and decided to upgrade for my birthday gift. I love my new Fitbit, it is less chunky than the blaze and sits closer to the wrist so is more comfortable to wear. The straps are a bit difficult to take off and put back on again and the length is a bit strange. I’ve got medium sized wrists and so the small band only fits on the last hole but the large band fits on the third hole, leaving a huge flappy end which can be a bit annoying.The interface is nice and I like the smart alarm feature that recently updated. There isn’t a huge selection of Apps so I’m not sure you could call it a true smart watch but it’s useful to be able to see today and tomorrow calendar and get calls and text message notifications.",4.0
"I ordered this as prime day deal and was really disappointed. I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max and most of the features weren’t even transferable. It doesn’t connect to Apple health. Most of the exercises and workouts on the Fitbit you have to be a premium Fitbit member for £7 month. Fitbit pay only works with a select few banks, not even Nationwide or other big banks. I was hoping for something more than just a device that checks my steps, my sleep, heart rate and tbh that’s all this device can do. All the clock faces you have to pay for so you can’t really customise it. Absolute waste of money if you’re hoping for more than just a basic watch with health monitoring. It was very pretty but the screen size was small. I think if you’re an iPhone user you’re better off spending another £100 which works properly with Apple. You can’t even check notifications or reply to messages on the Fitbit versa. Truly disappointing, I returned it after a day.",3.0
"Decided to upgrade from my Inspire HR...Pros:Very easy to set up- You need to download and join the Fitbit app. You then need sync the watch to the app. Charging the watch is easy, find much easier than the magnet type charger had on my HR.It tracks steps, flights of stairs, sleep, periods, calories, blood pressure and you can even keep a food diary. You can also download personalised backgrounds for your watch. It’s light and comfy to wear too.On the app you can add family and friends and do challenges together. 🙃Cons- The battery doesn’t last long I’d say 3/4 days Max.Also be careful who you add from the Fitbit community..Overall highly recommend if like me you love walks and like a challenge.",5.0
"It seems like a great product, I love how it tracks a lot of interesting statistics and the badge system is motivating.The battery only last me 2-3 days but it charges fairly quickly.Now to the not so great part. A week after I got it now, I have this red patch of itchy skin where the band has been. I have worn watches for years, including a different (really cheap and bad quality) activity tracker and I have never had any reaction to anything before. The skin is dry, itchy, red and swollen. Not ideal... it is expensive enough that I cringe at using even more money to make it wearable... I see now that multiple people have this issue or similar/related issues and that is not acceptable.",3.0
"Having got a Fit bit for Christmas and tried it out. Seemed to be good so got one for my wife also. Has good balance of features for price. My wife loves the colour and simple design. Easy set up, will connect to Spotify to enable play on Bluetooth speakers in your home. Also will connect to your diary, has weather app and usual alarm and standard watch features. Step/heart rate and sleep tracking is reasonable. Battery life is decent too.i did have some initial issues with app connectivity when trying to download watch faces but this has resolved. Rated 7/10. For myself I got a more rugged Spigen strap to replace original one, but found it less comfortable Than the silicone one supplied.",4.0
"I have only been using this for a week but so far have found it excellent.  It is much bigger than my Fitbit Alta, but is actually simpler to use and gives me more information and is more versatile.  I have added the screen protector, to make sure it's kept safe.  The screen on my Fitbit Alta eventually cracked, I presume with use, but possibly it was locked against something.  I will probably ask for a more attractive strap for Christmas!",5.0
"Bought this for my wife who wanted a fitness tracker.  Initially all was ok, charging was simple enough, the sleep tracker was erratic, for example if you sat still watching a movie it thought you were asleep.  However the reason for the one star rating and return was the inability of the device to link to the phone and app.  It worked to for almost a month and  then refused to pair with the watch.  We did try everything to remedy this.  Turning it on turning it off, reboot the watch uninstall and reinstall the app - everything ! Having wasted many hours we returned it and bought another brand.  Sorry Fitbit - either a Friday afternoon one was sent to us or it’s just plain awful!",1.0
"Poor all round. Started all good but ended up missing huge chunks of actives.I was looking forward to getting back into the swing of things but it’s failed miserably. Been wearing it for 3 weeks and it’s missed out loads of info which is just demotivating!The fact you have to pay extra for decent info about everything and that the device isn’t fully compatible with my lifestyle, most well known banks don’t trust the Fitbit pay.I’d rather save my money for a Samsung/Apple Watch or a garmin, seem better suited for real work.Huge disappointment. My 2nd Fitbit device and won’t buy again it’s just not worth the money, barely any improvement from first release",1.0
"I bought this for my wife as a birthday present and she absolutely loves it. The only problem with any of these devices is the way it tracks steps through an accelerometer. My wife has woken in the morning, on occasion, to find that she had already had 300 plus steps before she got out of bed. Usually this is on the weekend when the dogs snuggle with her and she is rubbing them.",5.0
"I do like this watch but I have found that the ""4 day battery life"" could have been wishful thinking, the best I can get is nearly 3 days but that's better than my samsung gear(only 2 days) or my Michael Kors smart watches (1day) when the battery is getting low I get an email telling me about it, WHY?! I can see by looking at the watch if the battery is getting low! putting music on it is a bit of a palava but I got there in the end but even then I have to keep pairing my ear buds over and over each time I want to listen to the music, over all I would not say that its ease of use is particularly good,  it is very sleek and looks good, I get notifications from WhatsApp and messenger.",4.0
"Loving this, had a Fitbit Alta for a few years which eventually wouldn't hold charge. Nearly bought an inspire but decided to splurge on this. It was a good price at the time. I have had a couple of times where it has stopped recording an exercise at around 3 minutes in which is annoying when you're on a treadmill and can barely see or balance to re set it without stopping but now I tend to re start it once a week and no issues since. Not a big deal to re start either. It has encouraged me to move more, you want to please it, and I've merged it with  myfitnesspal as I find the food data is better than Fitbit.",5.0
"I just LOVE this smart watch.my old Fitbit died and as i am now addicted, i had to buy a new one. I'm so glad i didnt go for the top of the range smartphone, as this one does everything I need and more. I love getting texts and notifications of phone calls.... So useful!  The heartbeat monitor is accurate and the exercise monitor again is excellent.  I love the sleep app and the relaxation app for when you get stressed. Contacting Alexa is also so useful. One big plus over my last fitbit is that I can see the screen readings whilst outside in the sun! My last one, it was not possible in sunlight and I had to get into some shade and squint to see the screen. It's a very attractive watch and has attracted attention from friend. I'm delighted with it!!!",5.0
I have had my Fitbit for 7 weeks now and over the last week the screen has become less and less responsive. To the point that now I can not access any of the functionality of the watch from the watch itself. Making it a very large and expensive traditional watch! Contacted Fitbit support and pretty much next to useless support. 3 days in to their preferred method of communication (Twitter) and I am still no further into gaining a fix or a replacement. Should have gone for a Garmin or an Apple,3.0
"I bought my Fitbit Versa 2 in July '20. In October '20 my fitbit overheated and wouldn't switch on at all. The warranty team were very helpful and said that they'd replace the watch for me free of charge. 2 days ago I got my replacement which had EXACTLY the same issue as the one I sent off and now Fitbit have told me that I need to pay to replace the second unit. I am now £200 down, without a device and Fitbit refuse to help me with this.Get something else imo, less hassle that way.",2.0
"I have been a loyal customer of Fitbit for years, but enough is enough. When working, this was superb, WHEN WORKING! After three months I got the non fixable, black screen that so many people have complained on Fitbit's forum about. As usual, Fitbit refuse to acknowledge this. Over the years, Fitbit's quality has been declining. You buy a fitness tracker hoping to have a reliable piece of kit. I have now bought a Garmin Vivofit which is infinitely superior in every way. Fitbit need to sort themselves out and acknowledge loyal customers when they are bringing legitimate concerns to their attention.",1.0
"I really like my Fitbit Versa 2. I’ve owned Fitbit devices in the past and so found the interface easy to navigate around. It’s a fabulous way of monitoring your activity and encouraging yourself to exercise more. Plus the design is much neater than previous iterationsThe app really compliments the device. I must confess I don’t use it to it’s beat as I don’t track my fluid and food intake as I should.I do find on iPhones if I sync the phone to the device via the app just prior to trying to use GPS when running, walking etc it finds the GPS signal faster.Overall a very good device",5.0
"I bought this tracker in Sept after having had a good Fitbit experience previously. I should have read more reviews!! Watch worked OK at first although frequently didn't sync automatically and sleep/step trackers worked intermittently but not badly enough for me to return it. Then suddenly after only 2 mths just wouldn't turn on! Haven't done any strenuous exercise or ever immersed it in water. Thing was stuck on Fitbit logo. I rang Amazon and they suggested it was best to go via Fitbit so connected me. Spoke to a bloke who quite frankly seemed bored and irritated by me, put me on hold multiple times and for minutes only to come back with, ""Try putting it on the charger"" and ""try turning it on""!!!! Then ""OK we'll send a replacement"". I asked would it be a refurb he said they ""try"" to send out new watches! Of course what arrived today? A refurb! If I'd wanted a refurb I'd have bought one instead of paying full price only 2 MONTHS ago! Now I have something that has already been broken before and someone else has worn on their sweaty wrist! Gross! Especially considering the whole situation at present!!! Can't reiterate more - DON'T BOTHER! I'd have preferred they just fix my own watch. I don't have much confidence that this will last any longer than the first!",1.0
"Great watch, took me a while to set up all the different settings and still learning. Perfect for keeping a track of daily fitness, heart rate etc.Replying to txt msgs via the voice control is interesting doesn't always pick up what you say. To use spotify you need to have a premium account which I dont have, not paying extra for that feature. Really comfortable and looks good.",5.0
"Unfortunately this wasn't for me. It ran great as far as tracking goes but there are things you have to pay extra for which it didn't state when I purchased. My issue was the actual item causing some major skin problems. I woke up the day after first putting it on to extremely sore, red patches where the band had sat - I put this down to the silicone and sweating during the night so purchased additional breathable straps. Left the watch off until my new straps arrived and whilst my skin healed, finally put it back on and hours later under the watch interface unit was again red, sore and very itchy. After looking into it - This is a common issue with fitbit and fitbits only advice is 'Not to wear the device's.I've returned mine sadly for a refund",2.0
"My kids have been using and reving abot 'Fitbits' for quite some time now. Having recently retired from a job which involved lots of walking, I purchased the Versa 2, to enable and encorage me to continue to exercise. I wish that I had bought one ages ago. This product is so easy to set up, and  monitors steps, calories burnt, heart rate as well as having lots of other features. The Versa 2 even comes with Amazon Alexa included. Fitbit provide lots of support, and even award badges when targets are met. I cannot reccoment this product more highly. Everyone should have one.",5.0
"Microphone stopped working after a week..  the app always has to be in the background.  If I've been typing on my computer it says I've taken a hundred steps. There are a few extra useless apps on the watch.  All round rubbish.  Only good thing is that it tells the time. It stopped responding to touch half the time, and after half a day the battery runs out and  I cant do anything or send the watch back.",1.0
"Unfortunately I have to put 1 star for Fit bit. I had the versa 1. The screen suddenly went blank and I could not see anything. Then I upgreat to versa 2. I had it only 1 month, yes 1 month and yet the same problem. Blank screen. I got a replacement end of August, and today end of October surprise... blank screen again. 3 out of 3! And just to meantion, I do not go swiming with it, I do not wear it on the shower. I was looking after it so much. So diccapointed on a 150 pounds watch. I bought a dead cheap 15pounds for my husbant 5 years ago and he still has it in perffect working order.",1.0
"I recently bought this product on a sale price. I have been looking for a smart Watch for quite some time and when I saw this I couldn’t resist. From the moment I received the packaging in the post I could tell that the product was high quality. It was an extremely durable box with a nice and neat design at the front that was quite appealing. As I opened the package i could see the watch. The pebble felt strong and durable and the strap was a sturdy silicone style material which I found extremely comfortable to wear. It came with the charger and a second strap for larger hands. However I was disappointed to see that there was no specific instruction manual on how to use or set up the watch however after a quick charge (100% cant have taken longer than an hour) I set the watch up via the app. The watch can have various apps and clock faces added via the app and you can set up notifications and Fitbit pay (use your watch to pay) which is an amazing feature. The notifications of this watch are really good as they are similar to phones and easily accessible on the watch. Another feature is that you can answer calls from the watch.Overall, I believe that the Fitbit versa is a remarkable everyday watch which can be customised with various straps (if bought) and I would recommend it due to the high quality of the product.",5.0
I  loved being able to track my workouts. I thought it was a pretty great fitness tracker overall but I was very disappointed with the software issues that messed up with the heart rate monitor. The syncing was not always easy and the texts/calls would stop coming through for no reason - I didn't mind so much as my main use was as a fitness tracker but as a main feature of the tracker they should have been working. I gave up with the poor heart rate tracking and I am so thankful that Amazon provided great customer service in processing a return.,3.0
Brought a few of these as gifts a couple of mouths ago and the people I gave them to are really pleased with. They work well and seem accurate. With the ability to receive messages and notifications as well as the fitness features makes it a great all round smartwatch.,5.0
"Present bought as replacement for a successful first generation Versa, nice quality, arrived quickly. A little confusion over the changed interface and moving music is unnecessarily complex, but the recipient is a very happy bunny and has played with it incessantly since Christmas. A little trepidation over the replacement wrist straps as that tends to be the part which fails first, but will see how it goes. So far nearly a month down the road all is going swimmingly - which incidentally is something that it excels at monitoring swimming.",5.0
"love this. that's all there is to it. compared to the previous versa, this is a big step forward. the screen is so much crisper and nicer and the battery life is epic. the software is also much improved for better integration to android and of course with the fitbit smart scale. i have not used the alexa functionality yet, but the other features are all just that little bit better compared to the last generation of this watch.the build quality is also superb, it feels comfortable on the wrist and is nice and responsive and very intuitive with very little learning needed.excellent item.",5.0
"Great as a fitness tracker but other app's are not worth writing about. I brought this for my wife, luckily she only wanted a fitness tracker but I thought I would spend a bit more money as this could play music and had built in Alexa. Alexa isn't great it will only display text and is very limited to what questionsit will answer. The music app isn't much better either. I have a galaxy smartwatch which is so much better value for money and user friendly. If you want a fitness tracker go for a cheaper option and save your money or if you want the app's buy an actual smartwatch.",3.0
"This is utter rubbish, not accurate at all, sitting at my desk for 5 munites got me 250 steps, brushing my teeth got me 300, eating cereal got me 200, it's stupid by the end of the day it's saying you've done 78998000 steps, also if you want to connect the music apps like Spotify you need to have the £10 subscription or you can't use it, waste of money don't bother buying it",1.0
Brought this to upgrade original fitbit which I had no issues with the watch kept closing down and now does not work at all wrong time zone kept appearing not recording accurate states goid looking watch but very frustrating with so many issues awaiting replacement from fitbit thanks to Amazone support will give it one more bash but not holding out much hope will be asking for refund shouid not advice buying,1.0
"You are better off with the 20£ variant of the fitbit as its always synced to your phone, this on the other hand will only sync once you spend 30-40 mins resetting everything turning apps off and on trying multiple WiFi networks turn Bluetooth on and off and even then you have a 50% chance of it syncing, I have not managed to sync it in the last 4 days. It's not worth the effort. I've had it for just over a week and have synced it maybe 2-3 times with a lot of effort.Looking online you will find many more people having sync issues, and the usual text book answer is do a factory reset, which I've tried and it also doesn't work all the time and its not really a sustainable solution as you cant be expected to factory reset it every other day just so you can sync it",1.0
Bought for my wife for Christmas. Should have believed the bad reviews. Connected on first attempt. Since then has not stayed connected more than a few minutes. Won't log sleep and has now started to lose time. App won't connect to Wi-Fi. Even Fitbit web site is full of these problems but seems unwilling to help owners or resolve the problems. Am now returning to Amazon. Am really disappointed as it was a gift for my wife. Won't buy Fitbit again.,1.0
"ProsLooks niceStrap fits a small wrist of 5.5''Not feel fiddly when navigating.ConsOnly bank fitbit pay works with is Santander.Can only respond to text messages, WhatsApp (can do this by speaking to text)Can answer incoming phone calls BUT the microphone does not work with the watch so the conversation must be from phone.I purchased this item for the use of being able to call people if I had a fall. The fact I cannot even initiate a text let alone phone calls is a massive flaw. Also, the fact that you have to have a Santander bank card to even use fitbit pay is a big problem for me.Would not recommend this product for an extention to communicate with people.This is just a poormans glorified fitness watch.",1.0
"I have had several Fitbit in the past including Charge Hr & Blaze.I love my gadgets but I'm not a tech expert so this is a review from an every day user without huge expertise.Pros - display & screen look sleek. Stats are accurate & watch looks nice.Negatives - I have had to update software & this was a nightmare. I've had to restart phone, reset Fitbit several times. When I could see that upgrade was eventually kicking in, it too over 3 hours & an amount of stress. I haven't experienced this with my previous watches. Alex for me is pretty useless & as many other reviews have stated, I don't think the pay app will be supported in the UK.If I could go back and buy another model then I would have gone for Versa 1 or the Iconic.",3.0
I have been using this product for several months now. I like the fact that is easy to use and looks really nice. I had to buy a different watch strap as the original one gave me skin irritations. I have had other smart watches before and honestly for the price difference this Fitbit does not add much features. I love the fact that you can use it to pay contactless and the possibility to control Spotify is great and works perfectly. It is a pity that you must pay for other elements such as clock faces (some are still free). In general the app has a nice and intuitive design and it is very useful to add information such as food and water consumption. It also helps create a personal goal based on your activities. Some of the features are only available if you use an android phone. I would not recommend this if you are an Iphone owner. For example you cannot reply to the messages if you are using an Iphone. Maybe it is better to spend a little more for an apple watch in that case.,4.0
"This is my first negative review on Amazon.I don't know much about its features because I didn't use it myself.What I know is I bought it for my boss and it had a problem with a charger within three months.So, I sent it to repair with 1st class royal mail since 5 January, which I had to pay by myself for7.65 pounds.(They got it since 6 January.)What would customer expect from customer service of a brand that is more expensive than others?Yes, good customer service.However, it is not what I expect.I expect fast preparing for my boss.But I needed to ask for preparing progress three times and always got nothing.The first two times, I asked on Amazon chat.They told me to wait, 48 and 24 hrs.And I got nothing twice.Then I just knew that I could contact Fitbit directly.I contacted them since 25 January.They told me that they would check my case with their higher support team.And I got a tracking number in the next day (26 January).The case would be solved.However, that tracking number can't be tracked until now.It means I waste my time almost a month for this brand, for the item that is more than a thousand buck.I don't know what's next.But I'm sure on thing that I will never suggest this brand to anyone.",1.0
This is a great watch/tracker though my wife finds it doesn’t always count all her steps. Battery lasts about a week and all the built in features are really useful. I have one too and the silent vibrating alarm is good if like me you get up before your partner. There are many replacement straps available along with different faces to ring the changes.,5.0
"I had this watch for almost 3 months and the screen popped off in the shower hanging only by the cable inside. EXTREMELY disappointing as I was more than happy with the watch in every other way. But that's all irrelevant if I can't use it for longer than 2 and a bit months. This is baring in mind that I'm very careful with it, only work out occasionally but showered with it every day with the understanding that it was waterproof. This is my first and last watch from fitbit.",1.0
"I love this watch and tracker as I also love their app. I started training for a 5k run I have and this helps to track dostances, heart rates and times among other things. I also purchased a cover since I have my 2 little sons and 2 cats and I didn't want it to get scratches on it and thank God I did it.All in all this is perfect for me, not sure for advanced runners but it makes me happy and keeps me motivated and guess what? You can also use it to pay for your shopping! Absolutely amazing",5.0
"I love everything apart from the device...I’ll keep this short and to the point...I purchased this to monitor my workouts when cycling. It says that the watch must be 2 fingers above the wrist bone during workouts and this is the result of 2 weeks of having the device. As you can see it has seriously damaged my skin and I note I HAVE NO ALLERGIES WHATSOEVER. If the device is loosened it does not read heart rate correctly... so wear it right and loose the skin on your wrists or get false data, not good.The battery indicator is faulty and displays whatever the charge level it was at when removed from charge (e.g 75%, 98% or 100%) and stays showing that until it runs out of battery and died. Fitbit support told me that this was normal and it was my error... not sure how it is my fault that it dies at a battery level of 98%!Actual Fitbit software is amazing, this watch is a disgrace. I’ll be returning or exchanging for another model.",1.0
"So far so good! I decided to upgrade from my Fitbit Charge 2. The Versa 2 has more features and options than the Charge 2. It doesn’t feel bulky and is really comfortable to wear. I also like the fact you can swim in it, although I haven’t yet.I had been debating getting an Apple Watch, but decided I wouldn’t use a lot of the features, so the Versa 2 is just perfect for me.",5.0
"Best purchase I have made in a very long time.The Fitbit app is so user friendly with a lovely interface that’s not difficult to understand.The watch itself looks stylish and you forget that you even have it on.LOVE that my notifications go through to it.LOVE that it tracks my sleep.LOVE that it tracks my activity and fitness (I’m a total beginner and this has made me get moving again, such a difference!).LOVE that it has a built in alarm so I no longer have to wake my partner up with the horrendous iPhone alarm tune.LOVE that the battery life means it last for 4/5 days before a charge is needed!LOVE everything about it. Such a great little purchase!The only downside is, the screen of the watch is SO easily scratched. Without knowing mine has scratches all over now which is disappointing. I would recommend buying a cover before wearing properly.",5.0
Reliable (and good-looking) gadget - I used to use a small Fitbit tracker but now wanted something with a bigger display that can handle more than just tracking and this is perfect,5.0
Bought this for my wife for Xmas.  As she already has had many different fitbit watches . She tells me this is the best of them all. Both from the information presentation and the viewing of the information in sun light conditions. Appears to give her accurate information as she is always doing comparisons with apps loaded on her phone. If she is happy then it must be good.,5.0
"My new Versa 2 Fitbit. I received delivery on 27.11.20 it was fully charged.  When my battery was getting low I put it on the charger.  After a few hours I checked my Versa 2 only to find it was not charged and the battery was almost flat.  I contacted Fitbit who gave me suggestions on what to do to sort the problem but none of them worked. By this time the battery was flat.  I was about to return the Fitbit to Amazon but thought I’d try the old charger, it fit more snugly into my old charger than the new one so you can assume from that that there was no connection.  Within seconds my Fitbit started charging. In the instructions that came with it, it states you should not use an old charger, if I hadn’t I would not have known the new charger was not fit for purpose.",5.0
"Love my new versa 2, I didn’t want to go for the 3 or the sense as to be honest I’ve been contemplating upgrading to Apple Watch later in the year.I was worried it would look too big on me, but I needn’t have.I’ve always had fitbits since they started, only sorry I bought a charge 3 last time instead of the versa 2! But the versa 2 is making me question the ‘desire’ of the Apple Watch!I love the sleep tracking,  but steps and heart rate are the most important feature for me.Super duper easy to set up, although I haven’t connected my Spotify or AirPods yet.  Nor have I tried the spo2 feature, (but I guess I’m not bothered to as don’t understand it, and I’m fit and healthy anyway)Heart rate seems accurate, I’ve taken my pulse and then checked the Fitbit and they are very close.Great battery life, I’ve got it on screen always on mode so it eats up battery quicker but I don’t mind.",5.0
Ok so review time. I have had the fitbit for just over a week now and i can verify its the real deal ( not a knock off. It comes with 2 straps small is already on it then it comes with a large that you can change over to ( if you have a bigger wrist.) you can change the background as you can see mine is stitch and its overall a really good size and a nice product. I also got a screen protector because the screen is glass just to warn you.Ok now down to downsides. For starters i got the fitbit because i knew it had like a kinda apple pay thing but its really restricted with cards which is frustrating so that means i cant pay with mine ( hoping that add my card soon haha) secondly tue charger it comes with is a good charger but the cable will bend and break so this is my only warning. Other then that the product is great and really useful and pleasing to the eye.,5.0
Loved it. At first. It appeared to be fantastic. But today the watch has burnt my skin so now I don't want to wear it. It wasn't an irritation from the strap. I actually felt it burn and immediately took it off to find a sore red burn mark on my wrist where the back of the watch sits. Very disheartening as I really did love this watch.,2.0
"Bought as I lost my pervious watch, when I read about it was really excited about being able to download songs to the watch, but wish I had read all reviews 1st as like the others said you need a laptop/computer which I dont have as like nearly everyone I use my phone/tablet.Can't believe that a company as big as fitbit hasn't sorted this yet :(Still a good fitbit would be fantastic if I could get songs on it.",4.0
"It is absolutely crap. I brought a £20 one in January which looks the same and works much better and does more, the only plus was this watch had spinning on it and the maths on that is wrong, I worked hard, i was pouring with sweat for 30 minutes and it said 94 calories burned whereas my other app said over 300. If you think paying an extra 100+ for it will make it a better watch then like me you will be very disappointed. It doesn't even count the steps correctly. You have to pay £8 a month for it to track your sleep etc whereas my £20 watch does it for free and my much cheaper watch does the blood pressure and blood oxygen. The fitbit is a rip off. Don't waste your money on it like I did.",1.0
My favourite fitbit design so far. I much prefer the larger clock face compared to other fitbit like the Charge as it's much easier to see the time and my steps. Maybe it's just me but the Spotify link seems a bit redundant and Alexa will only work when my Fitbit has access to WiFi so they're not great for when you're out and about. Still I love the amazon exclusive purple and rose gold combo and I have found the app finds and syncs with this fitbit much easier than the old ones.,5.0
For the sole reason that you cannot connect to spotify & change tracks whilst doing a workout. Yes I can download music to the phone but that's a head ache.The spotify thing is heavily marketed for this phone. Very disappointing not to see multi-tasking when doing a workout.,3.0
"For the price, I was hoping for more to be honest.Took a long time to figure out syncing, and even then, it wouldn't half the time. Only had it for about 24 hours before deciding to return for a refund. Amazon handled brilliantly though.Maybe I didn't give it a fair trial, but i was massively underwhelmed for the price I paid. Couldn't get it to use the Spotify app, which was a big thing for me. Would rarely sync notifications either, another big deal for me.If you're thinking of getting one of these, I'd probably recommend saving yourself a few quid and going for the original versa or lite. Almost identical functionality and less damage to your wallet/purse!",2.0
"This is my first Fitbit and god am I pleased I chose it! Easy to install, set up and sync with my phone app- really clear instructions and tonnes our helpful tips to get you understand I how it works. Comfortable strap with spare included should you need a larger wristband. Wonderful strong colour and quality finish with face displaying crystal clear graphic. Would recommend buying a protective cover for it.",5.0
I have had this now for just over a month after it had been delivered to my parents in Scotland as I was supposed to be visiting and collecting. I had noticed that the battery was not as good as my 2  yeard Charge 2. I fully charged it yesterday and put it on around 5.00pm. Today I got the text at 4pm to say my battery was low! that is just disgraceful. I should not be charging a brand new fitbit every day. Not sure what to do with it...,2.0
I bought this for my daughter as she loves it. It’s the second one she’s had the first being an older model. It’s obviously a good watch and she loves it otherwise she would not of wanted the same type of watch. So from what she’s said it is highly recommend. The only negative issue was the plastic strap it came with irritated her wrist where water would sit under it after she’d had a wash or had her hands in water so we bought the metal strap and that has been better,5.0
"Very limited smart watch. It is not a good value for money. Better if you get a Galaxy Activity, miles better.The tracking system is questionable as it isn't GPS based.The app is limited as well, many issues with synchronization and Bluetooth connectivity. The music apps are reduced and only works with premium Spotify.The touch screen response is not good, sometimes it is unresponsive and frustrating to going to settings as it keeps going to home screen.",3.0
"This Fitbit Versa2 is perfect, it's comfortable and looks good.  It's waterproof and the size is good with a clear, easy to read screen.  I had a Verrsa which was also very good but I upgraded to the Versa2 and it's brilliant.  I definitely recommend it.  It comes with a spare strap if you need to use a bigger one. I can't think of a single negative thing to say about this Fitbit. Very pleased with it. Also, nearly forgot, it only needs charging once every 7 days!",5.0
"I was initially unimpressed with the Versa 2 as it is very unreliable with syncing - it can be a real chore to get it to work. Like 15-20 minutes with the app open tapping 'Sync now' but it always failing without giving a reason. Turning all day sync can force it to work but drains both phone and watch battery at an accelerated rate.My next issue occurred when a blue stripe appeared on the display which wouldn't go away with rebooting or changing watch faces which were the only suggestions from Fitbit support. Then today I noticed I'd not got any notifications through the watch despite having messages on my phone. When I looked at it, it was stuck in a bootloop flashing the Fitbit logo on and off with no way to reset. Holding down the back button does nothing, so I think my only option is to wait until the battery runs out (it was reasonably freshly charged) and then see if turning it on will do anything. Just an absolute garbage product and regret buying it every day. Thanks, Fitbit!",1.0
"This was ordered to replace a Garmin watch (wouldn’t recommend). The Fitbit app is great, I love that it can count the steps and I can see them so much faster than my Apple Watch. The sleep tracking isn’t the best, it’s not very accurate but it’s better than the Garmin watch for that. The App is also much better than the Garmin. I love that you can swap the straps easily. The built in Alexa is also great as I use Alexa to control my smart home. It’s high quality, you can tell it’s not cheap or plastic. The battery life is great, over 2 days out of mine easily.",5.0
"Had a fit bit charge for years and a garmin. Wanted something that looked a little different with the same functionality.  First one died after about 3 weeks. This one has a mind of own: inaccurate HR monitoring during exercise (particularly cycling),  VO2 changed from 38 to 30 overnight, decides I'm on a run randomly, doesn't always store the exercise (transfer from phone to app), if I sit still it thinks im asleep.....Very disappointed. Will try to return as not fit for purpose.",2.0
"I have had about 10 different smart watches/ trackers and sad to say Fit bit is the most inaccurate of them all. At work I usually do about 9000 steps a shift, when wearing this watch it ended up around 12000. When I take my bicycle to work (12 mile roundtrip) it still registers around 1000 steps each way although the setting is for bike. Overall Im not happy and feel this tracker is a waste of money. Like the look, but not that it gives constant false readings.",2.0
"I like Fitbit because I do a lot of walking and like to keep track of my steps. I originally had the Fitbit charge 3, and this did it very well. However there was things I thought the 3 was lacking compared to the versa, a coloured screen, Spotify, and the addition of Alexa. After thinking about it for a while I thought, why not treat myself and upgrade. Here's the thing. The versa is prettier, I like that it has a coulorful screen and more customisation options. But If you don't care about that sort of thing. It's exactly the same as the charge 3. Spotify connection very rarely works, and when you finally manage to get it connected, it only stays connected for a short while before disconnecting again. And the addition of Alexa (because she doesn't speak out loud) is mearly a novelty. Overall I don't mind that I purchased it, as it is prettier to look at, but solely on what it can do, I would of just been happy keeping the charge 3, as I personally just used it for keeping track of my steps and my swimming. The charge 3 will give you your text and call notifications, it will keep track of your exercises, everything you need it for. The only thing it's really lacking is a coulorful screen.",3.0
Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband as his last Fitbit eventually died. We have both used for it’s for at least 8 years and love them. This one hasn’t disappointed and it’s such a good idea for the built in Alexa and downloadable songs. The lots of watch face options are a nice touch too,5.0
"A word of warning. If you are thinking of getting one, beware!I just want to bring this to your attention.I bought a brand spanking new Versa2 yesterday.The device itself is a very smart piece of kit indeed, and I  was looking forward to setting it up.It'll be a breeze I thought as I was upgrading from an old Fitbit Blaze and already had the app..which I have loved for 4 years.Er no.Hours of the trying to get it to work was to no avail.Frustration Big Time. Then I realised I was not dumb/alone.Fitbit has hit a big problem as many other folks will contest to on the Google play reviews and Fitbits forum.. My new Fitbit and many others will not sync to their phone.I am very much not alone.An app software update has deemed many devices pretty useless right now and at the time of typing needs fixing. There are reports too that the updated app won't work all of a sudden on some phones..If I had known all this I wouldn't have forked out £150.And now, I'm returning my device.",2.0
Brought as a present for my mum for Christmas as I've had 1 myself for a few years now so I already know the versa is a great piece of tech. My mum isn't very tech savvy but she loves it! Loves beating me on steps every day and finding out how much she's moving around. She loves how easy it is to read the watch face and the texts on the home screen.,5.0
I bought this as a replacement for a Fitbit Ionic which I unfortunately dropped and broke the screen. Apparently no way to repair so thought Id try the Versa 2. Turns out when swimming there is no way to see your laps as you swim only afterwards on your phone. I believe the marketing blurb is very misleading. Setting up was very glitchy. Its a shame as nicer looking than the ionic but on balance Ionic is a better watch.,2.0
"Hi.First the connectivity of the watch isn't very good and succeed or fail at random. I wanted to upload music from my computer and it took me several tries to finally succeed. Not sure why tried with bluetooth off etc but just decided at some point to work. (Tried to add more music later on failed again. So didn't try to connect it again...)I suppose they didn't want to make it easy to upload your own music to promote Spotify etc...Also there are no Volume control. I tried to manage the volume through the phone, the PC, the watch itself. Also learned about the absolute volume but nothing worked. The volume is WAY TOO LOUD and I am not the only one.So I will just send back the watch. there are plenty of watch who track sleep, heart beat for way cheaper. As the audio option is useless.The Fitbit website is terrible if you look for any solution. And customer service just bring you to the website. So your best friend is google and youtube.I still put two stars because  the watch give the time and still look pretty.I was going to try and change it for the Versa 3 but decided to check the potential issues and could see that volume was TOO LOW on this one.So I will just move to another brand.Still good watch if you don't care about the audio. But again there is way cheeper for the rest of the options.First time disapointed by an amazon choice.",2.0
"I ordered this watch as an upgrade from the basic fitbit for my wife for tracking exercise and text messages and answering calls playing music but none of this works. I've reset the watch restarted the phone but still does not work, complains about a service not running and to restart the phone to fix.. Does not fix the issue..I have searched the internet and see I am not the only one having this issue, Fitbit need to take a look at there code and fix this bug and push out a fix.. This watch is not value for money..I don't like leaving a bad review but in this case I had too.",1.0
I bought this and all was well for two months. Then it wouldn’t turn on or sync. Contacted Fitbit who after back and forth sent me a replacement. Not new and not boxed up etc so I suspect it’s a refurbished device. It won’t sync to Bluetooth so I can’t even find out if it’s working properly. No what I’ve come to to expect from a reputable company. Avoid like the plaque.,1.0
"Problems for 2 days to connect to fitbit app and Alexa app which was very frustrating.Then trying to connect Deezer, Spotify which I now believe that you have to be a premium member to use. I did think the sound would come from it but must be used only wirelessly.But now all set up I  love the design, the size great for my eyesight, brightness, the apps come in very handy.Speaking to Alexa is a good feature.Love the feel of the soft feel strap.",4.0
Am so disappointed with this fitbit. I have owned a fitbit for over 4 years and moved onto versa 2 but have had non stop issues needing to email fitbit support at last once a fortnight. The screen freezes so I can't get to use any apps and the tracking info is wrong as often as it is right.,2.0
"This product was purchased for a friends birthday. He was excited to receive it however the set up was a long painful process that still wasn’t achieved a day later. After multiple resets of the phone, watch and the app we could not get the device to sync - the Bluetooth setting was saying “an app is required for this” - we had already downloaded the app and set up a profile too. I am appalled by the quality of the app and when searching for a solution online I discovered that this is a common theme in reviews where people are struggling to connect the watch to the phone. After another 3 hours last night we decided to package the item and return. This is very infuriating because my friend was looking forward to using this new watch as it was his birthday present. Lots of improvements and bug fixes need to be made to the app before I would recommend that anyone buys it. Don’t waste your money or time on this!",3.0
"Unfortunately, I will be returning this product to the seller as it arrived dysfunctional. Firstly, I wasn't kept up to date with delivery of the product however, it did arrive earlier than originally stated. More importantly the watch itself WILL NOT SWITCH ON. After an afternoon placed in the charger all that shows is the logo screen. I downloaded the FitBit app and entered all my details however I CANNOT SYNC MY WATCH to the app on my phone. Even worse the week after I purchased this product it was reduced by over £30. Terrible product, I would not recommend purchasing the FItBit Versa 2 from here. My return request has been submitted.",1.0
"Fitbit is the easiest fitness tracking to use in my opinion (tried garmin and iwatch) the versa was quick and simple to set up and is easy to navigate through the screen.  Nice selection of watch faces to choose from on the app. The watch automatically detects running and doesn’t require you tapping ‘record’ like the iwatch. App has features like sleep tracking, weight loss, water intake, calories as well as the usual steps, floors etc.",5.0
"i purhcased this watch a few months ago and I must say that I am extremely unimpressed. For a watch that costs £140, it should actually be able to do the stuff it says to do - and it should be made far more clear that it is not fully compatible with the devices that follow the Android OS 7.0 and above compatibility in the description. You have to scroll down to the fine print to see a link to a pdf of a list of devices that are compatible.My watch is very poor when it comes to tracking distance. I noticed that for the majority of my runs, the distance is way off after comparing it to google maps. The other day, I went for a run and compared the fitbit with Strava and found that Strava, which is very accurate, measured my distance as 3.8km, whilst Fitbit measured it as 2.9km. This is quite a big difference and also means my running pace, which I am working on improving, is very inaccurate.Customer service is pathetic too, they only give you the most basic troubleshooting advice, even when the product clearly has a fundamental issue with it.",1.0
I’m so pleased with my versa 2.It delivers on all apps efficiently.It’s easy to use and I get the best out of everything using it.I’m so pleased with my new Fitbit and I couldn’t have got it at a better time in life.,5.0
"I brought this fitbit for my best friend, for her birthday. She absolutely love it!. She's a complete fitness fanatic an goes on endless walks with her huskies. So she's delighted now she track her fitness. Also creates goals for herself too keep pushing steps too the next level.She did mention that the sleep takers not as precise as she through it be, but still really useful too track her sleeping hours.She absolutely loves the Alexa built it, really useful tool on the go.",5.0
"This thing is useless. It doesn't do what it is supposed to do. I would expect it from a cheap watch but not from a company who was founded on quality tracking watches.I work at a desk at home and apparently do 10k+ steps a day and also sleep walk because it tracks steps before I am out of bed. The sleep tracker is OK but believes I'm asleep if I lie still for a few seconds so inaccurate at best. I would not recommend this product because I  can only really use the notifications and time,  all the other features do not work as intended.",1.0
Wife is very happy with this watchApp is easy enough to useBattery life is good heart rate monitor works as it shouldSo far so goodAs a precaution she has fitted a screen protector which she purchased from Amazon (CAVN) if anyone is interested this actually clips onto the watchand does not interfere with the operation of the screen (i have no connection with this company),5.0
"I had the Fitbit Versa but sadly after 3 years it started to die on me. I got this as an upgrade and I’m completely satisfied with it. I don’t use it for music so can’t comment on that, but as a fitness tracker it works perfectly! Haven’t had any trouble with it as of yet!",5.0
"Bought as a direct replacement for my wife’s ageing Versa 1. She said that it is better than the original in both battery life and function.

Worst watch on the market. App renders this watch unusable and the updates are few and far between and when they do update you will be spending hours trying to put the update on the watch. Dont waste your hard earned money. If you don't believe me look at the reviews on the app itself. 1 star reviews for months. Utter garbage. Its had a huge reduction in price for a reason and in my eyes you should be paying customers to take these off your hands. Not charging for them.,1.0
"I bought this mainly for the sleep tracking but the smart watch features were just going to be a bonus. The smart watch features are nice but quite limited. The biggest let down for me was the sleep tracking, The first night it said I only got 3 hours sleep when I had slept for well over 7 and the next night it didn’t even track any sleep. After some online searching I was advised to tighten the strap so it can read it better. After 2 more nights of no sleep tracking, I took off my watch and gave up. When I took off the watch I discovered I actually had blisters where the strap was from it being so tight. I contacted fitbit for support and they told me to tighten the strap so the watch can track sleep better but the reason I got blisters is because it was too tight... No further ‘help’ than that and they refuse to admit there is anything wrong with their device even though a quick google search of ‘versa 2 sleep tracking problems’ will show you otherwise. All in all a waste of money and would return for a refund if only they would let me",1.0
"Gps seemed fine, although the app wouldn't show the maps for my runs. It was super easy to set up and download my music too, however the 1st day my phone notifications came through then stopped, after a number of help searches, resets I called Yr he help line advised me there would be an update, update didn't come after over a week sent back for a replacement, 2nd one was worse, only half of the exercise settings came through in the watch and still no notifications. Sent back and paid 30quid for a huawei band 4, much easier just can't download music, but it does do what I wanted it too. Xx",1.0
"I have had this for some time now and can compare it with Apple version too.The greatest advantage for fitbit v2 is its battery life .Amazing app for tracking your activities and connectivity to strava for fitness freaks is simple ( though I had some issues initially due to my own lack of technical knowledge).No GPS in versa 2 but they have sorted this in versa 3.Just for that reason , one can choose to go for v3 as u don't need to have a phone with u for ur exercise.Not used for music so cannot comment.Just the battery life makes it a clear winner over apple .My next upgrade would be versa 3 or fitbit sense for sure. I will certainly stick with fit bit as I am very happy with this product.",3.0
"I got this as a Christmas present for my mum and she loves it. I have got myself an Apple Watch and they are very similar yet different. I couldn’t connect my bank card with the watch for some reason and it’s due to the watch not accepting my bank.It does track the calories and the steps and that is what she wanted it for.Looking wise is very sleek and looks very smart. The band thick and looks very nice. She is happy with it, but you will have to do your research and check that the watch is compatible with the things you have already.",5.0
The look and screen of the new versa is great looks fantastic on your wrist..however be careful buying if you have tattoos I wear watches etc on my left wrist which is tattooed with the Blaze and ionic no problems but with the versa 2 it will not track heart rate sleep or active minutes I tried everything in the end I switched it to my right wrist and now working fine... apparently the tracker lights on this device struggle reading heart rate through tattoos,4.0
"Not happy with this purchase at all. Alexa couldn't hear me unless I literally screamed at my watch or tapped the microphone first. The app synching is so so, couldn't make my notifications work. If they did work I had no idea how or why and then it stopped working as magically as it started and couldn't make it work again. And microphone felt like it had some water in it or something. Not sure if anything was wrong with my watch or if it is just serious software problem. Either way, returned it as it's not worth the money. The only thing I liked about it were the looks and all the apps. Too bad. I will wait till they improve.",3.0
"During the time I have had it I have owned both a Samsung S8 and Huawei P30 Lite and is very bad at syncing for both of them. As a consequence of this, I have to refresh/sync the app everytime I want to log an activity and use Alexa... might as well just use my phone rather than spend the money on the watch. On top of that, it has the ability to connect with Spotify and can change songs using the watch, but it doesn't allow it when you are in the midst of recording an activity... the only time I would want to use this is when I am running, so there is no point in having this. Also if you want to use this to use contactless payment, it is only compliant with a limited amount banks, most which are not large banks - the only bank I have heard of in the list is Santander.",2.0
"It's enough to say that my wife likes it. As a fitness tracker and watch it works well, it's lightweight too.

My wife likes it especially as it does not need charging every day. Enough said.",5.0
"Dreadful product. I’ve had a Fitbit charge before and it was great. I upgraded to this watch and wish I hadn’t. Brought in early July, battery life was ok (3-4 days) but not great. One day it went from half charged to dead and would not charge. Fitbit did checks and declared it faulty so sent a replacement in late August.The new one did not hold its charge at all and the battery went flat within 24 -28 hours. Despite stripping out all the notifications, brightness etc so it was effectively  just a bog standard watch it did not improve the battery life. After three weeks of frustration Fitbit acknowledged this one was also faulty and offered another replacement. I’d lost faith after having two go wrong in three months so Amazon promptly refunded (good service compared to the hoops I had to jump through with fitbit).I’m going to get a different make of tracking watch instead.",1.0
"I had to get this device replaced within 3 months as the screen stopped responding. The replacement I received arrived with scuffs to the back and from day 1 i have had connection issues (meaning it won’t sync to my phone reliably regardless of any troubleshooting) and the battery lasts half the time. I have been trying to get this sorted for 2 months now with fitbit and they have been nothing but unhelpful being passed from person to person and them now telling me that I have to wait  indefinitely for them to decide how to proceed. I am left with a device that won’t track my steps on my phone as it won’t sync, I can’t use it for notifications or any of the other features other than time, heart rate and step counting for that day and have no track of my steps previously on the app as it isn’t syncing.I would not recommend this device to anyone I have had nothing but trouble and the customer service has been an absolute disgrace.",1.0

There was and is a big issue with this device; we walked for a down walk of 3 miles and it calculated it as 11 miles along with the calorie burn you would expect.

"Until this purchase, which was a gift for my wife who has undertaken a work from home fitness regime during the last year, we have always gone for the cheaper versions of fitness type trackers. These of course don't have the anything near the quality or durability of the genuine Fitbit which I have to say are significantly superior in build quality. So far this model does what it was designed to do and connects to the app without difficulty. Happy wife...Happy life..!",5.0
"The FitBit Versa 2 lives up to the name as being one of the most versatile watches within a good budget. Obviously you can buy super tough smart watches with all the tricks in the book but most of time they’re large, weirdly shaped and have so many features which you just don’t need or will ever use. The sleek shape of the Versa 2 makes me forget I’m even wearing sometime and has truly become a part of me. It has benefitted my fitness and general health with stats and guides that everyone should want to know. As well as providing useful tools for your day to day life. A truly sleek and easy to use smart watch with a great community to socialise with.",5.0
"I am a keen fitness person both teaching fitness and doing my own personal training. This has all the functions I need. I love the detail of the watch and the app is brilliant. The watch makes me get up and move which is great as I have a desk job and suffer with my back if I sit too long. It is motivational, great functionality, everything I need.",5.0
"Useful services are hidden behind paywalls and subscriptions. The software is a bit buggy and requires hard resets from time to time. Whatsapp messages don't work with Iphone. I have since bought the Apple Watch series 5 and it is so much better, worth every penny. Do yourself a favour and spend the extra money on an Apple watch. It is better in almost every way.",3.0
I absolutely love my Fitbit. I can go 4 days without charging it and it is super fast to charge. I use it for everything all day everyday and it’s so helpful when it comes to workouts. It’s very motivational too and when you put your goals in it will continue to hound you to get up and move if you want to lose weight or be more active. I couldn’t be without it anymore - I genuinely love it and for the price I paid its so worth it!! 10/10 for me,5.0
"love this, great battery life 4/5 days... i wear mine everyday - not always to bed as it doesnt feel that comfy. it tracks my running when i forget to switch it to running mode, only problem ive had is sincing the fitbit to strava app. when i record on strava it syncs to fitbit but not the other way around which is very annoying. i also find that when i use the strava app - when it syncs after my run my steps can sometimes go down... sometimes upto 1/2000 which is odd.but i think i might need to get it looked at. anyway great buy and super happy with it",4.0
"Upgraded from a Fitbit blaze, didn’t realise how they have come on since I had my blaze. Clear screen with option for large clock display, works with Alexa . Do just a tiny bit miss the buttons on the side to turn the volume up and down when listening to headphone but looks better and overall feels like a worthwhile upgrade from the blaze if you have want a newer one",5.0
"I upgraded from an Alta HR to this one. I’m happy with it but the most annoying thing for me is that you can’t download music onto the watch. You can control playback of music via the watch which is still handy in the gym but you need phone nearby which is not so much.You also can’t use the payment function (like Apple Pay) unless you have a Santander account or one of the obscure banks listed. But that’s not an issue for most people because if you have Apple Pay, you’re just as likely to have your phone with you as your watch.",4.0
"This is a nice little watch, which shows clear and simple information. The sleep tracker is excellent which has prompted me to get Fitbit premium! I use the ‘always on’ display and it usually uses 15% - 20% battery per day. It’s really comfortable and very lightweight. I have only used the ‘walk’ exercise tracker but it is really good. I will be using the hike tracker when my fitness improves, then I will use the running tracker. The only downfall is that you have to bring your phone with you when you’re out tracking your exercises but I do hear they will bringing out a Versa with built in GPS! All in all a nice little watch and looks very trendy too!",4.0
"Bought this from Amazon in December. I've been back and forth in contact with Fitbit as it doesn't sync properly and have NEVER sent notifications of messages from texts or WhatsApp - they said it was a known issue they were working on but gave me no ETA. They persisted on closing the support ticket despite the Fitbit not working as advertised.Now, 5 months later - theyre since blaming it on my Android version despite always being told it was a big they'd worked on. Now I can't get a refund.I'm so annoyed considering I paid £169.99.If you're on Android or expect the manufacturer to follow up with support issues - don't bother.",1.0
"I bought this to replace an older version and love the big face and how easy it is to read the screen, took me a while to work it all out but absolutely love it and would recommend.Nice big charger included and extra strap part to fit larger wrists.Had toyed with getting iwatch but as a tracker you cant beat the Fitbit.",5.0
"Love my new versa 2 fitbit, I used to have the fitbit Inspire but decided to upgrade to the versa, it was easy to set up and the battery life is really good and I like the size of the face and the ease of use, it also has more exercise functions which I like, all in all I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend",5.0
Bought as a gift and I get updates on how brilliant it is all the time. Sleeplessness is a problem and the watch is encouraging relaxation and making improvements on a night's sleep.And then there is all the other fitness stuff that works well.Currently playing with the Alexa app and ear buds and enjoying what it can do.,5.0
"After purchasing the Versa 2 over the Versa lite I was disappointed to find that most of the features in the Versa 2 are not compatible with my own accounts/devices.To use Spotify you need a premium account, to download music you need use of Mac or PC (I have chrome book) You can use fitbit pay in UK as the banks listed if never heard of and does  it include any of the main UK banking retailers. None of these caviats to the use of the fitbit are advertised clearly enough for me to have realised before I purchasedSupport from Fitbit comprises of them sending links to troubleshooting articles, of which I'd already read before asking for support and did not answer my questions.I have had to delete and re- download the app several times just in order for it link and log into certain apps.I feel the step count in in accurate as I wake up and it's logs over 100 steps.",2.0
"The watch itself seems ok. But the GolfApp does not work, tried it twice and just doesn’t do anything. It finds my course but that’s it!!..... UPDATE... golf app just does not work reliably. It freezes, doesn’t Always hole advance, and the App developer Never responds....Real shame.",1.0
"I was really excited about this product and then I wore it for 3 days and I was extremely disappointed. It has now been over a month and I literally hate it. The bpm is off, we have a bpm machine at home and I’ve tested it against that and the Apple Watch and the Fitbit is ALWAYS wrong. The sleeping pattern NEVER measures, I wear it every night fully charged and it just doesn’t measure anything. Non of the wallets work because it only works in the US. (I’m from the UK). Also the motion sensor doesn’t work so you have to flick your wrist three times to then actually click the button (yes I have checked the settings are correct) just to see the time. This product just annoys me and I can’t return it because the box got lost in Christmas packaging. I wish I’d have spent a little more for an Apple Watch.",1.0
"I bought this as a gift to my wife after trying Fitbit inspire band didn't fit her wrist. It looks so cool and stylish, my wife really happy with it.There is nothing wrong with the app and tracking information the watch providing compared to most smartwatch. But compared to my Garmin watch it's definitely not on the same level of details and accuracy but considering it's half the price too I'm happy wth it.",5.0
I love my Fitbit Versa 2. It was an upgrade from the charge 2.The strap is a beautiful colour.It’s very modern and I get lots of compliments on this watch.It does everything I need it to do,5.0
"It is a cool watch but there are to many things that are not working.Connection is not working at all, and without that you don't receive notification, it doesn't track your sleep, can't see the weather on the watch. You can't pay with without the connection, the App is not sincronize how it supposed to.Basically it's a normal fitness tracker (steps,floors, kilometres,calories, heart rate and exercise)Those are the only thing that are working.But at this point you can spend less money for the same service.It's not only this one I've got now, I've change 3 (bought, refund or changed) cause they all had problems. At the end I kept this last one as a normal fitness tracker cause I was so fed up.",1.0
"I love this especially when it e-mails me when its battery gets low. I only carry my phone and wear this watch when away from home, so the battery prompt is very useful. I will probably buy a different strap despite this coming with a small strap and a large strap. I have a small wrist and the small strap works but I prefer a softer strap material.",5.0
Great product. Wish I had bought this first instead of buying cheap versions. Connects great to my Samsung mobile and it is very user friendly. Battery life is great too considering how much I use it. The colour has not faded in the strap either.Would recommend buying a screen protector for it.,5.0
"The battery life is rubbish. Since having my fitbit (1 seek) I’ve had to charge to it 3 times. It doesn’t last the 4+ days it says it does. Also, you only get 2/3 workouts meaning to get full use of the coach app you have to pay for a monthly subscription of £7.99 on top of the £200 for the Fitbit itself - very cheeky and money grabbing!!",2.0
"The watch seems decent in terms of performance however, the fitbit app is a nightmare, half the time you need to use the desktop to set up things like music. The desktop version then guides you back to using the mobile app which does not work.I could go into depth about how setting up this watch has nearly given me several brain haemorrhages but I'll save you the rant. I'd recommend spending a little more and getting a different product where the app isn't detrimental to the setup and operation of your smart watch. Would not purchase again.",3.0
"I've upgraded from Inspire to Versa2, but I will return it.I've been using it from one week now and I noticed that my burnt calories are way too high than it should be. For the amount of money we spend on these devices, we expect quality. Smart watch functionalities are useless, the mobile app is a joke.I will move to another brand. Very disappointed.",2.0
"bought for the wife mainly for the SPo2 function as advertised-it even says it on the box, but alas there is no option on the watch or app to show SPo2.. Trying to download clockfaces, any of them, but also the SP02 one, from the app is like pulling teeth-update : before clockfaces or anything works, it seems to need a few days to settle in on your phone app, your watch firmmware then updates at somepoint and apps and clockfaces will then download ok from the store... they really should put a warning for this, as such i've updated the review and star rating as it now seems to work as intended..",4.0
"Bought as a gift for my wife. Shes over the moon with it. Slight connectivity issues to begin but these were sorted with alittle internet troubleshooting.Works well, impeccable battery. Its been 3 days since first charge and it reads 50% still. I'm very happy that shes very happy with this purchase.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",5.0
I have had problems with this from day one. There was issues with syncing the watch and eventually it seemed to work. Then every single day it had trouble syncing. Sent the watch away and they sent a replacement or a fixed one.. not sure which. Now I cannot receive any notifications and the syncing problem is still there. Don’t waste your money,5.0
"So far better than the Charge 2 I previously had. Strap colour is more purple than the picture which seemed more burgundy to my eye. Compliments the rose trim though.Good for a fitness tracker but some ""smart watch"" features are useless - payments for example you have to have a specific bank to use.Unclear how accurate the calories/steps are as I have nothing to compare it to but overall pleased with the purchase.",5.0
"I have had fitbits before and loved them but this one is great the display is so clear and easy to use, the only thing I don't use is that pay app as it doesn't have my bank on it so thats a bit annoying but thats the only thing I can say thats bad about it. I dont use the sleep tracker as I don't sleep with it on and I charge it every 3days or so",5.0
"Love this watch having had a Withings health mate watch, this feels good quality, especially the strap, so soft. The watch face is sharp and the screen colours are vivid. Activities tracked with 7 accessed easily from icons in the fit section. 1000s of clock faces. Alexa assistant at the push of the big button. Tracks sleep heart rate and the app is brilliant. Highly recommended",5.0
"I'm converted! As someone rather old school who has an obsession with watches, I had made a promise to myself to never get a smart watch. But hats off to FitBit, I'm fully on board now. The watch itself looks great. Very modern and sleek - I did buy a replacement strap out of personal preference but the one it came with it fine. There are lots of free customisable options for the clock face, plenty of settings and the software seems smooth. The sleep tracker has proven to be very accurate and it's ideal for day-to-day wear as well as when working out.",5.0
"Counted steps like mad, I did all the steps to reduce the sensitivity as per guides but it still was counting steps even before I got out of bed, while siting etc and then over counting calories I’ve burned because of it - rubbish, returned it!",1.0
"Bought this for my wife. The Product was rubbish, the set was too complicated and not user friendly.Hence returned it back, but unfortunately had to pay postage charges for a dull product.Hence, after this experience, very unlikely to but a Fitbit product from Amazon again.",1.0
"The band on this watch is far too uncomfortable, integration with other apps was inconsistent which was part of the reason for purchasing. Syncing with the Fitbit app was also too unreliable. Returned for a refund",1.0
"I am a techy coder and rarely have trouble with electronic devices. Everything about this watch has been a painful experience. Despite multiple factory resets, turning both phone and watch off and on again repeatedly, trying to connect to an android device has failed. This stuff should be simple by now. After three days have still not been able to even get the watch to update its firmware properly.After doing much searching, found that despite my Huawei P8 Lite meeting all the specifications for this product and software, there are still workarounds needed. The work around instructions provided by Fitbit for my phone bear no resemblance to the menus available on my phone.Clearly a poorly conceived and poorly tested product.",1.0
"I decided on this watch after some careful consideration, I have only had the Versa 2 since January 2021 and already the battery doesn’t last any longer than two and a half days??? It is supposed to guarantee four days?? It feels like the watch has been on charge longer than on my wrist",2.0
"I love this product, it’s my 3rd Fitbit. The only issue I’ve had so far, along with other people after reading comments, is that I can’t connect my device to the internet. I tried a couple of times and gave it up as a bad job.Otherwise I really like the watch, the screen seems quite resistant, the added features are good (Alexa and Spotify app). I would recommend",4.0
This is a welcome improvement on my previous versa.  The display is simpler to use and retains the same monitoring as before.  Being Fitbit I still have access to all my historic data which this Versa 2 is appending to the existing data.  Shame they still haven't added GPS to it's functionality - oh well.  Maybe in the next incarnation.,5.0
"Bought it for a releative, great little device and has lot of functions, alexa built into it and tracks steps walked, calories burned and other things which i unfortunately cant remember but are really useful. includes a charger for the watch. Great item and came brand new.",5.0
"Like everything about this smart watch. Have had the previous model to this one. But this is a brilliant upgrade. Easier to use via the touchscreen, longer battery life, I recharge it every 4 days. Also works with Alexa which is useful.Well pleased with my purchase.",5.0
"For all it’s shortcomings this watch does do what it says on the tin. Great at tracking steps, workouts, runs and giving you a rough idea of calories burned through exercise. However, I have now gone through 3 of these watches in less than a year. The only reason I have continued to use it is because FitBit have replaced my broken or faulty watch each time, otherwise I would have moved to a competitor much sooner. FitBit have been great whenever I’ve had an issue, but if you want something that’ll be durable and last a couple of years then this isn’t the watch for you. I will be moving to a competitor when FitBit stop replacing my watch each time it breaks.",3.0
"Husband got this after I got my charge 3 because he just has to be more fancier than me. He loves it, although the NFC pay function isn't great at all, the bus didn't register it and neither did the barriers at the tube station. Other than that, it's a great smart watch.",5.0
"I'm really disappointed with this smartwatch, as a watch I love it, it's beautiful.  However, as a fitness tracker it is not tracking anywhere near accurately at all...if I run 3.1 miles it thinks I've ran 2.3-2.5 miles, even when I connect to phone GPS.  I would return this but already binned the packaging :-(",2.0
The fitbit is great. Lots of watch faces you can download in the app. Lots of features you can use. I like the fact you can connect headphones and listen to music but was disappointed I cant listen to my amazon music through Alexa on the watch. You have to have deezer or spotify.,5.0
Easy to use and set up. Tracks activities sleep accurately. Notifications work well... Just wish u could load goggle pay onto it rather then it's own pay app.,4.0
"Had the device for a matter of hours. So far, unimpressed. It won't detect my heart rate. You can't change the clock from 12hr to 24hr through the app, have to go to the website, which doesn't work. Now i remember why I went to Garmin 2 years ago. And still the same issues 2 years on. Preparing to return",1.0
"Bought 2  Fitbit watches a Fitbit versa 2 for my wife and charge 3 for myself, 8 months later both had screen issues ... not buying another Fitbit ever. Extremely disappointed, a cheap fitness watch would have lasted longer.Fitbit Improve your reliability or otherwise no one will buy these watches again.",1.0
"It’s got me moving so much more,, I had a cheap version, that seemed to take forever to teach 10000 stepsI really had to flog myself to get there.Put my Fitbit on took my dog out Did our usual route, that on my old one would say I’d walked around 2600 steps.On my Fitbit I’d done 5300 on our first walk. No wonder I was so tired at end of day. On my Fitbit now I’m averaging around 17/18000 steps a day .",5.0
"I love all of the features however was very disappointed to learn it does not allow me to see my text as the Samsung A70 doesn't work with it (only their own fit watch) very disappointed as my Samsung J3 did, I  didn't know until I had worn it for  a few days.",5.0
"Very happy with it. Battery a bit disappointing at 2 1/2 - 3 days. Don’t really use sleep tracking but it seems to be working fine, great for tracking exercise as well as steps. Music can link Spotify but not Amazon (surprising given it has Alexa) and for music with no phone the actual MP3 files need to be loaded from a computer.Heart rate monitor is good and the fat burn zone minute function is very useful.",5.0
"I’ve had 4 versa’s now, all broken. 1st one the screen went after a few months and I received a replacement. The screen popped out of that one when I was swimming. It’s was about 18 months old so I bought this one in February. In September I had battery issues and was sent a replacement. The replacement is faulty, the screen doesn’t scroll. I’ll be trying to get a full refund and will go with a different brand.",1.0
"Charge lasts around 4 days, Apps are good though one key feature missing that i think should be free is sleeping heart rate and not as part of premium monthly payment. Heart rate, Fitness and sleep tracking are all great. Nice big easy to read and use screen.",5.0
"A bit useless when it comes to HIIT workouts but quite good for running. The minute you move your wrist slightly or sweat it loses your HR and is almost impossible to get back. Good as a step tracker, running watch, although not always accurate with mileage. Battery life is fab - 3-5 days normally.",3.0
"While the watch is great and performs perfectly, the same cannot be said for the strap provided. Already the bit to put the strap through has snapped ( same thing happened with my old versa) and strangely it has a spare half strap provided but no spare strap holder.",4.0
If u want to listen to music you need to subscribe to Spotify or deeper. More accurate than charge 3. Trying the 7day premium. The wellness section is really good. Watch dues not feel too heavy. Bought when discount was on and bough a woven strap separately. Can't wear the plastic causes irritation/heat,5.0
"I've had mine around 4 months now and overall it's pretty good. It tracks steps and activity well, battery lasts about 5 or 6 days before needing to recharge and it recharges very quickly.One downfall I would say is the connectivity. I have set mine up to notify me of calls & messages and the ""find phone"" feature. However, sometimes the watch isn't fully paired with my phone and so I miss notifications or ""can't find my phone"". When this happens I'll either need to go into the app to resync the watch or I'll need to turn off and on the watch/phone altogether.",4.0
"Great, had a Fitbit blaze and it lasted a long time but the charge didn’t last long enough anymore so felt it was time for a new one. This is more accurate than the blaze; just knocking my arm will not add steps like it would’ve done with the blaze. Happy customer",5.0
The watch works well but has issues. GPS doesn't work most of the time and when it does it cuts out a lot. The LED that reads your heart rate broke after 3 months and that was one of the main features I brought it for. Steps counting varies as far as 5000 steps even if I do the same thing each day. When scrolling through the apps on the watch it lags. It sometimes has issues connecting through Bluetooth to the phone app. The wallet app only works with unknown banks e.g not mainstream ones.,3.0
"Great piece of kit but totally speechless about how utterly useless the charger is. It would be better with a normal mini USB but you have to clip it in to this ""thing"" which doesn't stand properly - difficult to explain but you'll soon see what I mean!!",2.0
Adore my new fitbit. My fiancé got it for me for Christmas and I couldn't be happier with it. Great battery life and I love the fact that it can be customised with colourful clock faces. Does everything from sleep tracking to blood oxygen levels. We'll pleased with it.,5.0
"I am happy with this watch, and it is good value, although I have a few niggles, although I am not sure whether the problem lies with the watch or with the phone. Some notifications do not come through to the watch although the necessary permissions seem to be given. Although I have set it to be displaying the time all day, the battery lasts well.",4.0
"I love the colours of this one, had it around a year now and still love it. Just dislike how fast the batteries go down on products like this, tried a few different brands and all seem to be the same. App and watch work well, no complaints as yet",5.0
"This is a good watch and the Fitbit app gives a really good overview. But the problem is that it estimates too much rather than giving actual data. So without wearing the watch you’ve already burnt 700 calories, because it determines according to your heart rate, which stays the same as the last time you wore it. It’s a good piece of kit, but if you want really accurate results, it’s flawed.",4.0
"Absolutley rubbish delivery....driver left this and a number of other items on my doorstep in full view of a busy road!! This item is nearly £200!I even have ""leave with a neighbour"" on my delivery info.... very angry! Something needs to be done about this!",1.0
"This fitness tracker will only work/sync up with some models of phone/operating systems. It failed to collect to my phone, nor my Windows 10 PC. I got on to technical support and they confirmed that this is an ongoing, unresolved issue as the Versa 2 is not compatible with many makes of phone.Buy with care (or don't buy at all)!",1.0
Love this! I wear it all the time and really love checking the app at the end of the day to see my progression. Only downside is the sleep tracker isn't 100% accurate- it's good but it isn't as sensitive as I'd like. Still love it and would recommend.,5.0
"I absolutely love my watch. I have a heart problem and it is pretty accurate in recording my heart rate.Steps are not always that accurate as chopping veg and stirring food in a saucepan seems to clock up steps, but most watches I have had also have the same problem.It is easy to use and I would recommend",5.0
"My deezer doesn't  sync probably. I cannot comment about the sleep tracking as I do not sleep with it. It looks  good, but I am probably not using all of the functions, the function I want to be working I.e the music function has not worked properly despite contacting Fit Bit directly",3.0
This is not a smart watch. If you want app and all other shrinking phone then this is not the one.This is the best BIG display fitness tracker and not smart watch. And I must say is the 98% accurat. Sleep walk and hear rare.And good battery life.,4.0
"Doesnt sync with the app. Can get it to sync by switching off and restarting g on both app and watch, but means unable to use half of the functions such as alexa, find my phone, etc as is not connected. I thought it might be a problem due to outdated phone but have changed phone whilst owning watch which is no better.",2.0
"Really glad I upgraded to this model. I had the charge 2 for 3 years, there was nothing wrong with it but slightly scratched and felt like an upgrade was due. The amazon Alexa feature is really helpful and love the colour. The relax feature is also amazing! The Alexa feature reacts to holding down the button and then speaking, not just speaking.",5.0
"Its my first fitbit and smartwatchI love it. Nice design, comfortable and stylish, generally accurate, waterproof, the app is good. Havent had any issues with it Good battery life. Have to pay for premium for everything which is why its 4 stars.",4.0
"OMG I love this, looks beautiful and the app is amazing, basic if you don't pay  for the premium package but in my opinion £7.99 a month is well worth it, there are the options to add people as friends and you can do group challenges to really motivate you to get more steps in etc, would give this more stars if I could",5.0
"Nice looking watch, ended there for me. Notifications work temporarily and you need to delete app and redownload again to make notifications work but only work for an hour then gone again. Needed a week of tech support to get Alexa to work. Got conflicting ""support"" from Fitbit, was told my phone was not compatible but is, and advertised as compatible. This watch ended up being an inaccurate step counter that could monitor your heartbeat, nothing more. Advise strongly against this brand especially down to their support who have no idea about their own product.",1.0
"Initially I was pleased but now I would not recommend. Try a Garmin watch instead - cheaper and better.Apart from the rash this wearable tracker gives you, mine stopped autotracking exercises and will not sync with Strava. I've contacted Fitbit who come back with helpful responses Like ""sync your strava app"". Don't waste your money",1.0
I found it difficult to use. I downloaded the app but it is so confusing. Fortunately the watch looks superb so I am more than happy to wear it and it does record my steps and heartbeat which is great but I cannot fathom out how to get any more information from it.,4.0
"I bought this item in December and it has already stopped working. The touch screen doesn't work, it doesn't count stairs and the on-off button is intermittent. I've reset the device more times than I can count and even factory reset it which did nothing. I'm so disappointed, as I loved the FitBit Versa2 when I first got it and can't believe it's stopped working in less than 4 months",1.0
"Great watch, easy to use, great features, does everything I need. It does occasionally leave a little red mark from the heart rate monitor. Also not 100% accurate as it thinks I'm walking when I'm washing up, but mostly it's pretty accurate.",5.0
"broken already, scene completely blank but green light on so it's like it is on but screen not showing anything. Being charged £7.99 a month for Premium which I didn't subscribe to and no way of cancelling, been trying 5 months! As was somehow set up to charge to my works mobile phone bill Vodafone they are saying to contact Google Play and Google play are saying they can't find! all in all a nightmare and wouldn't buy one again!",1.0
"I bought this after looking at the reviews and mainly not wanting to pay that little more for an Apple Watch just to see what it’s like. Wore it for over a day easy set up etc. But the calories burnt throughout the night were just over the top. I burned apparently 900+ calories in my sleep, I don’t remember doing a half marathon in my sleep to be honest. And my heart rate was always apparently through the roof! It’s a good product but I’m now going to buy the Apple Watch as I think this would be more accurate and just a better product in my opinion",3.0
Terrible reliability. The screen kept on crashing and freezing intermittently. This got gradually worse until it completely froze and became unusable.,1.0
"Great upgrade from the FitBit Blaze I had.  Lots of extra bits it can do over the Blaze.  So far worked out great.  However, the only issue is the wrist strap connection.  I've had the watch for about 2 weeks now and it's fine, but I still don't feel 100% like it's really on properly.  I felt more confident with the blaze type straps as the watch section just clicked in place.",4.0
A lovely product bought to accompany my android phone.  No problems so far. Seems accurate so far. Haven't used it in the gym yet (obviously 😁).  I've linked it with my phone and iPad and had no problems. A great buy so far. Will update again with anything significant.,5.0
"My wife is delighted with it and her  being a right wee geek, finding you can add LCARS as the style of display was just gravy.",5.0
Love this Fitbit. I thought it would look too big on my wrist but it’s actually a good size and so comfortable to wear. It does exactly what it’s says it can do and I love all the extra features it has. My last Fitbit only counted steps and my sleep pattern. Very happy with my purchase.,5.0
"I wanted this watch for sleep information, not exercise. I love it - fabulous insight into my sleep patterns and I read the Health Metrics every morning. Oxygen saturation measurements very important in these difficult days!",5.0
"If I could give 0 I would. My versa 2 worked for 4 hours then wouldn't return to the screen, just flashing the Fitbit logo and could not reboot it as it would not allow me. Fitbit company did not return any emails I sent",1.0

So disappointed with Amazon. Had to return it because the box appears damaged and there is no fitbit watch inside. Just the charger and one strap. It seemed that someone has opened the box and took the watch. I am extremely frustrated as it is not a cheap product and has to wait for refund,1.0
"Really not very good. In the two weeks I owned it I had to reset it to communicate with the app on at least four occasions until, eventually it refused to communicate at all. Sent it back. Now the refund is taking a very long time.",2.0
"Fit bit stopped charging so was returned. Was asked to send original box and instructions, luckily I still had themWhen returned was without the box, which I want and without instructions which i also want.New Fit Bit does not seem to fit charger properly and keeps on popping outAmazon just keep saying are escalating  matter but nothing is getting sorted.DO NOT BUY THIS",1.0
"Excellent product.  Love the design, the clock faces can be changed and seems accurate.  Love the features.  I can listen to music, see texts and calls coming into my mobile, it even links to my ring doorbell to get notifications.  Got it at an excellent price too.",5.0
"Good watch. Looks average++, does the job it's designed to do.However, it isn't compatible with OnePlus phones which is horrible on their part as it is one of the most popular phone manufacturers out there...It worked like a fitness band for me..... No notifications, no smartwatch features and I had some problems connection and refreshing earlier on...Returned it....",2.0
"This is great but you don’t get notifications from apps like WhatsApp or Facebook messenger this would be very useful. Only text messages and calls. Works really well for sleep tracking, 95% of the time it’s accurate.",5.0
Replacement device.Took an age and half a dozen attempts to get the obligatory update downloaded and installed.Apart from that it is fine.Hope it lasts longer than the last one (6months).,4.0
As the versa is much more watch like it is an excellent productLoads of worthwhile features to encourage you to do more exerciseBattery life is quite  good and the amount of free watch faces available is fantastic,5.0
So far so good. The battery life is impressive. I’m charging now at 21% after six days. Have used it to replace my running watch also. It was easy to set up (I’m a techno-phone). Aesthetically it’s great too. Love it,5.0
"Great tracker, sinks much faster than the Blaze. The only thing I'm not thrilled about is that I cannot rearrange the order of the types of activities, as I wanted to have the ones I do regularly to come first, but hopefully this will be resolved with some of the updates to follow. In general, I'm pretty happy with this purchase.",5.0
Bought as a present for someone who has huawei p20 pro phone and currently uses Fitbit charge 3 with no issues however this Fitbit IS NOT compatible with the phone despite being listed as supported on Fitbit website. Very disappointed and is currently being returned.It will work if you just want it as a fitness tracker but it will not receive any notifications therefore completely pointless to upgrade to this watch.,1.0
"The strap has made my wrist itchy and sore. If I want to use it going forward , I will have buy a metal strap. Reading the reviews I realised that some people have faced similar kind of problem. My skin is generally not that sensitive and I have used Fitbit in the past.  Something for people to keep this skin irritation problem in mind before investing.",3.0
"I like the watch, hourly reminding for your daily steps achievement, battery lasting is very good approximately 3 days.Only thing what I’m not happy with is the running tracking. I usually use another running app Together with Fitbit and realised that on 5.3 km running distance the Fitbit shows only 4.27km. I downloaded another running app to see  the tracking there which confirmed 5.3km run. It seems that Fitbit is not very accurate showing 1km difference on 5km run. I personally think this is a huge difference.",3.0
This is my 3rd Fitbit over the years (upgrades) I love the additional features - I am obsessed with the fat burning heart rate zone - still some work to do on the food logging app to be fair - but overall it's great,5.0
The Fitbit Versa 2 does everything it promises. The battery life is good and I've only charged it a few times since getting it for a Christmas present. I can now track my exercise without having to carry my phone with me. I love the sleep function and the fact that it breaks down my sleep pattern so I can see how much of each sleep phase I go through in a night. I've also linked My Fitness Pal app to it so it tracks my food and water intake to keep me on target. I would recommend this to anyone thinking about getting this or a similar product.,5.0
"Very good good watch ,let’s you see your sleep patterns ,steps, calories and a lot more.Simple to set up once you download the app on your phone then you can customise it all to your liking.Gets you off the sofa and out and about burning calories and increasing your step count...So you can see what calories you can put back in on the sofa again.lol.",5.0
"Got one for myself last year and I was so good I got my partner one as a gift as well. He absolutely loves it. Good Battery life 4-5 days. And the app sends you a notification if your battery is under 20% so you remember to charge it. It tracks sleep, heart rate and steps. The built in Spotify function is cool too. I like to use it to track my runs.",5.0
"Very comfortable to wear and great at tracking my activity and sleep.  Reminds you to get active if you sit too long and also lets you k ow booked appointments from your calendar.  Also, You can ask Alexa questions.",5.0
I love this upgrade to my Fitbit. The mobile app is helpful and I like that I can track my sleep. I also like the alarm and the fact that the face is so easy to see and that there are many choices of face display.,5.0
I like the look and it all works very well. I did have to sign up to Fitbit Premium to get the most out of it but am on a free trial.The plastic strap is a no go for me as it makes you sweat and traps moisture. I have had a rash due to this. I am a very clean person and take it off every day to clean it. It just causes a sweat rash throughout the day.I have purchased a different strap to solve this problem.,4.0
Warning you will need a smart phone to set up Alexa .if I knew this I would not have bought,5.0
"Love it. Quite a gd battery life as I have it on display all the time , the battery life lasts two days for me.  Very easy to see as quite a large display of everything. I would highly recommend this Fitbit.",5.0
"Really love my watch, it is so easy to use and gives me a great insight into my fitness and sleep patterns. Flashy looking and very comfortable. I was worried it would be too big as my wrists are small, but it looks great. Oh it's lost time once but just, need to make sure Bluetooth it always activated. Battery life is also very good . Overall it's great and if recommend it.",5.0
"It does everything I need from a smart watch, but the battery life is shockingly bad, it doesn't last 48hours, so essentially I need to put it on charge most days. Having previously owned a Fitbit Charge with a battery life of at least a week i am very dissapointed",3.0
Probably good if you mainly want to measure you heart rate and count your steps. I had a Fitbit charge 4 before to record my runs on Strava.Bought the versa 2 thinking it's an upgrade but I was very wrong.  I was shocked to find out it does not have GPS! if I want to track my runs I have to bring my phone to use the GPS. Absolutely useless,1.0
"Wow. This has really highlighted how lazy, inactive and very little sleep I get. I’m not gona change anything. But it’s nice to know and have proof of what my other half has said for yours. Thanks fit bit.",5.0
I really love this.It's not perfect but it is perfect for my needs.Helps keep track of exercise and the heart rate monitor motivates me to keep going while exercising. I don't think it is fully accurate but it is good to keep track. Sleep data on fitbit is a bit disappointing but I dont use it much anyway.,5.0
"so sensitive. picks up almost 4 x more steps than other step counter.. even counting 100 steps, it comes up with almost 400..",1.0
Ordered on Prime Day 13/10/20 and won't charge or get recognised by Fitbit app.  Had 3 Fitbit products before without issue.  Amazon given poor customer service to replace.  Replacement is at Locker over a mile away when there are lockers at the end of my road and i have to drop the faulty one off over a mile away in the other direction at Hermes!  And I repeat - the item was faulty on delivery.  Shocking,1.0
Looks great. Love my finite. This is now my third and o wouldn’t be without it. Good size. Only quibble is that I don’t find the sleep recording necessarily that accurate but excellent for other functionality.,5.0
Love this tracker watch. Unfortunately I am allergic to it and waiting for my wrist to heal/get used to it.,5.0
"I bought this at the start of lock-down as I started running, the main purpose was to track my fitness and running times as I decided to start with all other sports cancelled.For a device that is suppose to have GPS it was awful, when i used other devices and friends devices and trackers to compare, the fit vit versa 2 was off as much as 2K (on a 5K run) sometimes, making it impossible to track progress and useless, I returned it mid run and am awaiting my refund.",1.0
"I really love this watch. It's smart, its quick and the functions, style and physical make up are all great. My moan is that, like with all fitbits, the calories seem inaccurate. They seem very overgenerous. Also I feel Fitbit could do some work to their app too. I often find my watch doesn't automatically sync with the app and sometimes it crashes or won't let me view my exercise page. Overall I would buy Fitbit again because of the price.",4.0
"Is a good watch but it loose connections a lot, I had to synchronise and set it up 4 time in 3 weeks ,this the reason I returned.",4.0
"Use this 24/7 it measures my sleep, my steps, has breathing exercises. The app is great has work outs and all sorts to choose from. The £100 fit bits so basically the same there isn’t really much difference, but the bigger screen I personally think it’s much better. You can’t see much on the smaller ones! Well worth the money. Just make sure you get a cover for the face otherwise it might scratch!",5.0
I bought this as a replacement for a Blaze and wish I had stayed with a Blaze. It will not stay connected to the phone making all the apps unusable. Contacted customer support and they wasn't very helpful saying that my phone isnt compatible with the Versa2 so tried three other phones all had the same issues.,1.0
Bought this for my wife and it's rubbish compared to a Garmin at a similar price point. I'd get a Garmin Instinct unless you're deep into the fitbit ecosystem.,1.0
"The watch Burned my skin, I wasn’t wearing the watch for long and my wrist felt hot and my arm started to hurt when removing the watch my wrist was left burnt and blisteredI was in pain for days",1.0
I love Fitbit and upgraded from a Charge HR to this. Unfortunately I have had to return as it hurt my wrist joint. I tried making it looser and tighter but nothing worked. I have small wrists and it just didn't sit comfortably.  Gutted as I was ry excited to have this new tracker....back to the HR again.,3.0
Not bad got this to replace my blaze. However doesnt have the sensor that can feedback on sleep apnea which is the reason I bought. My fault should have researched a bit better.,4.0
My daughter absolutely loves her Fitbit watch. She wears it every day and has it synced to her phone messages etc. The purple strap is cool but she got another strap which made it look like a completely different watch so we are pleased it's so versatile. Very happy I got this for her birthday and it didn't become another wasted gadget.,5.0
"I love this Fitbit, the voice function to reply to messages is really useful. However, the battery life isn't the best because it has so many different functions compared to a simple fitness tracker.",4.0
I like how it tells me how many steps I have taken in the day and makes me try to do more. It also lets me know how many calories i have burnt and records my sleep pattern!,5.0
my son got this for christmas loved it for his fitness  as he is fitness and sporty  now it as stopped working i can not believe  it didnt work for long please give us some help to sort problem  not happy at moment,3.0
Ok not impressed with useless system they uses if you want to change the strap size your spend a long time trying to get this stupid thing on absolute joke of a system and just about impossible to get on,2.0
"It’s good, just not good enough. 300 songs stored gives you surprisingly little variety. The contactless pay feature only supports about 2 banks in the UK, neither of which are mine. It does keep time though, and has an accurate step count. Maybe just get a cheap Fitbit and keep using your phone for the rest?",3.0
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   I love it looks great, great shape, comfortable, easy to use my only annoyance is the battery life as it only last 2-3 days.",5.0
I have returned my watch as the accuracy was way out on steps.  One day I clocked up18000 which for lockdown hour would have been a feat.  I have reverted to my £30 sports watch Which  is brilliant.,3.0
"I was so excited to receive this product.but  It does not allow calls to be accepted as it does not have a microphone and most annoying it keeps wanting a re sync daily, so does not accurately track your sports and movements. Very poor product, definitely would not recommend. Sadly I have wasted my money on this product. Appalling.",1.0
"Its an average product wrapped in Fitbit's marketing. Once you pay a large amount for a watch that causes rashes on your wrist, you then end up being pushed into paying even more to unlock a few more paltry features.",2.0
Got one of these to my wife for jer birthday. She loves it,5.0
Amazing watch. The best feature by far is the smart alarm. It finds the perfect time for you to wake up. Even if you sleep 4 hours you'll feel like you slept 12. No more grumpyness no more tiredness. It's also great to track your exercise and food intake.It's a great addition to your everyday life.,5.0
This is a great smart watch only down side is that it doesn’t always recognise exercise. Not a problem as you can start the exercise manually but if you forget that it doesn’t log it on the app.,4.0
"Arrived in good condition,Had a week and so far no problems, Synched with my phone and headphones without difficultyI don't know how accurate the readings are but they seem about right",5.0
Absolutely love it!! Feels fantastic. The only issue is with the app on my phone as it can be slow to load. Definitely better than an apple watch and would recommend,5.0
Overall I really liked the watch. It has a simple display and attractive user interface which led me to buy it in the first place. Message notifications work well and data seems accurate. Raise to wake does not always work but it’s still a good feature. However it always felt sticky on my arm and just overall uncomfortable so I had to return it.,3.0
"The only problem I have with this is that for all of the features to work properly it needs to be near your phone or connected to WiFi. So when I'm at work and my phone is in my locker, it's not connected at all",4.0
My wife loves her Christmas present. The battery last well over 5 days. Its tracks everything on its own. I am seriously thinking about getting one for myself 🤣,5.0
Very easy to set up with the app. Great way of tracking your steps. The sleeping information is very informative and useful. And tells the time as welL ha ha. Good 4 day life on the battery.,5.0
"I bought this for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. She has worn it since Christmas Day and has only had to charge it fully twice so far! She has used it to track various different exercises and loves the fact it shows up all message/social media notifications on the screen. Set up was easy and the device is very user friendly. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it.",5.0
"I couldn’t find alexa tile showing and I did this and it worked. Just returning to the account, select advanced settings and under the specified location, make sure to choose UK.  Then log back in and it’s worked.",5.0
I love my fitbit. Its so easy to use but I wish I had bought the one with the material wrist strap because it irritates my skin however  I do have sensitive skin .,5.0
This is not the first Fitbit product in our family and they have never disappointed. We also have the Fitbit Aria which makes a good complementary product to the Versa.,5.0
"I'm really very upset because I paid £159 for Fitbit Versa 2 Health & Fitness watch and instead I received a parcel with Lynx body-wash, how is this possible?!! How can Amazon allow things like this to happen at all, I'm just speechless! I even can't find where to file a complain about this!",1.0
It didn’t last long but I was given a 50 percent discount off a newer model or a straight replacement so went for the Versa Sense as I wouldn’t trust the Versa 2.,3.0
"My first contact with this kind of item. App is not the best and often need restarting and reconnecting to sync. Watch is very elegant and simple. Fairly easy to use. Would recommend, although app could be more on user side",4.0
So I have had my versa 2 for about three months now. Its was a really good watch but the last few days the screen has started flickering all the time to the point its not use able. I have never dropped it or anything like that also. It has no damage to it what so ever. Its seems im not the only person this has happened to also. Its a real shame as its a great watch but I just don't know if i want to risk getting another one now.,2.0
"I've found this great for keeping tabs on my sleep, exercise and food diary. My only gripe is that I sometimes get a rash (possibly friction or sweat) from the strap. When this happens I switch wrists or stop wearing for a few days. I tried loosening it to prevent it from occurring however it doesnt feel secure. Other than this its perfect.",5.0
It is temperamental when connecting to WiFi. Is hit and miss. When travelling from one time zone to another can take upto two days for the time to sync. Have got a replacement and experiencing same problem. My FitBit 2 works perfectly,3.0
Now the ECG monitor is finally released the value of this watch seems fair. I do find the sleep tracker useful and it does make you more consistent in going to bed. The exercise/ activity tracking is also good and accurate. Just needs Prime Music downloads and it would be a 5 star winner.,4.0
"I had the exact same issue with the first fit bit, but returned it and got a new one and now again it has stopped charging. I have bought new chargers in case that is the issue but its not. The watch now is totally dead, wont charge and of no use to anyone. It just seems to be a product problem as there are lots of reports onlineUpdate L Amazon has kindly offered to return it.",3.0
This is my 4th Fitbit and the best by far. Recently my last Fitbit had lots of issues in failing to sync but the Versa 2 works fine all the time.well worth the extra money.,5.0
"I bought this as my old Fitbit screen died after two years of extensive use and I love it. The app, the functionalities on the watch itself, everything. For comparison, I was given a Garmin by my firm to track activity and stress last year during the first lockdown and I hated it with all myself. It’s nowhere near Fitbit in terms of tech.",5.0
"I LOVE fitbits but this one has broken after just a few months. I use it for it's purpose - sleeping, exercise etc so it should be used to some wear and tear - just like my other fitbits. Unlike my other ones, this has broken after just a few months. One of the side buttons have come off and the since the fitbit has died completely. I've had to go back to using my trusty Charge 2. Getting in touch with vendor for repair or replacement.",2.0
"Bought fitbit versa2 on prime deal for my wife. Just within a week the strap broke. Hasn't happened with any other watches before. Upon checking with amazon they said they can only do a partial refund for a strap that is £5.09 for replacing with unbranded but compatible strap. The quality of the fitbit strap is really bad, didnt expect this quality with expensive watch from Fitbit.",1.0
My third Fitbit. More advanced informationLooks nice white/black. Very smart. I think it is good value and would think purchase would aid to kick start that new You.,5.0
"Returned mine as I couldn't get it to receive notifications from my iPhone and for some reason, there was a delay of an hour or so when it tracked my sleep.  Disappointing.",3.0
A great product severely let down by the fact that it does not support the major banks for its contactless payment system. Only Santander is supported in the UK.,4.0
"I bought it for my girlfriend for Christmas and and she loves it. She got more conscious of her daily steps and sleep patterns, just being more active and sleeping well. It was like the best present ever, then she clipped it off the side of the worktop during the week. The strap broke from the watch and just came off.It seems like poor quality, but every other function with the watch including the app and battery are very good.",3.0
Initially seemed quite good but messages and phone notifications stopped working after an update. There are much better and more affordable options.,1.0
"Bought for my wife as it was smaller than her original Fitbit Ionic, though personally prefer the Ionic.Nice watch, loves the Alexa integration and the look and design, happy wife, happy life.",5.0
"This is not as slick as apple but the accuracy on the fitness stuff is so much better the app is really good plus it works well with other apps like map my rideMy real gripe is the battery life 2 days at best I had a charge 2, 7 days between charges",3.0
Live this watch. Had everything  I need. Love that I can use it for swimming Counts my laps. Live that I can see time on the dark without wearing my glasses..,5.0
Average device. I think there are better fitness trackers out there.Not as accurate as Garmin or Apple after comparing each one after a walk.,3.0
"When working it was brilliant, tracked my steps, logged sleep and food. I would have given 4 or 5!Unfortunately it began switching off every 10 mins or so, then the fit bit logo would remain on and the device couldn’t be used.It has progressively got worse, turning off more frequently until now it only has a blank screen.It was a Christmas gift so hoping it can be exchanged or repaired.",2.0
"I love this new Fitbit. It works so well and I can barely feel it on my wrist. I sleep with it and it is great because it has night mode, so it won’t bother you in the dark. It has many options for the exercise tab, including Pilates. I love the celebratory fireworks when I hit my step target!",5.0
"I love this Fitbit. I got one for Christmas and bought this for my partner for their birthday.Lovely quality, easy to use. Long lasting battery.Only issue I have found is that the pay option doesn’t work for UK based users.",5.0
"Love my watch, love tgecway it tracks your walks and shows it on a map on your phone. Really clever watch. Only downside is the strap irritates my skin sometimes but its not to big a deal.",5.0
"Love this, very easy to set up and use purchased for step counter but this does so much more to checking your water levels to receiving messages.",5.0
My main exercise is walking for which I have to use a walking aid. This watch will not record steps or calories when you use a walking aid. It has the same problem with home treadmills that have a user grab rail.,1.0
Love the sleep tracking and exercise features. I never wore a watch and bow I never want to take it off. The mobile app is also very interactive. So pleased with it.,5.0
"Can't find fault with it other than the low battery life. It states 4 days, but because of the apps I have added its 2-3 days. I charge it up on my car journeys mostly",5.0
"It’s Fitbit so don’t expect too much. Minor problems are an almost daily happenings. Counting the minutes walked and it suddenly going back to zero, is just one example.",2.0
this is my first fitbit product and so fay I love it it does everything i want and with the app tracking as well its a great way to help you attempt the stay healthy,5.0
"Got the watch straight out of the box and despite trying to use both Bluetooth and wireless, I could not get the watch to update. After about 4 hours of trying all the suggestions on the Fitbit help pages, I gave up and sent it back.",1.0
My wife's birthday present to replace her Fitbit Alta . She is really happy with it and the app is well presented and both watch and app are easy to use once set up .,5.0
I am really happy with that watch. Moste important for me is fact that battery life is really good and also have connection with Dexcom G6 . Highly recommend !,5.0
"I ordered this for my mum, opened the box there was only one half a strap when there should be two full ones, a charger and there was no watch face either.",1.0
I love my new fit bit it's great the heart rate monitor is the same reading as the hospital ecg machine and fitbit premium is a must buy.,5.0
"Have been very disappointed by this, am using it with an Android phone and the notifications drop every few days requiring a full reset of the connection to the phone, meaning setting up accounts linked to watch each time. Doesn’t track GPS on walks or runs with phone in close proximity and Google Pay has been less than reliable. Contacted Fitbit about it but didn’t even get a response. Would not recommend to anyone!",1.0
"Arrived early which was great.. Looks good and read good reviews but giving as a present so haven't opened it. Nice packaging, feels good quality.",5.0
"So it's a really nice watch, the display is clear and the app is pretty straight forward. As a sleep tracker or fitness tracker there is a glaring problem though, if you have a tattoo where you want to wear your watch it's not going to pick up your heart rate most of the time. My old Charge 2 could manage it just fine but sadly not the versa. Still a nice smart watch just a bit annoying.",3.0
"Amazing!! I bought this as my daughter has one and we now compete to see who has the most steps a day. The sleep tracker is really good I’ve just upgraded to premium package and there is loads of wonderful tips for sleep, exercises etc. The only downside is the strap makes your arm sweat a little and if you change the clock face it drains the battery more, so I would suggest keeping the original",5.0
"I'm on my 3rd day and really liking it, I'm already moving more and being generally more active. I'm also logging food and drinking my RDA of water.",5.0
"If you are looking for watch that looks good and tracks steps, exercise, sleep, calories burnt etc then this watch does all that.Nice large screen too.",5.0
This has made me able to focus on improving so many areas - activity - fitness - relaxation- sleep - workout programmes. It looks good too and would be lost without it.,5.0
"Love my new Fitbit. Had a Fitbit charge 2, the screen cracked 3 times so I finally gave in and bought the Versa 2. I love it, great looking, easy to use and familiar too. Has payment option and Spotify too, not used Alexa yet. Would highly recommend.",5.0

Arrived quickly.  Had watch few months now love it . Only use for time and fitness.  Dont use music as it doesn't.work with Amazon.  Great text message acknowledgment would recommend,5.0
Present for my daughter. She loves it & can wear it while swimming. My wife already had one so no reservations buying a 2nd.,5.0
"My Son loves it. Had an original fitbit but lost it, which was great too ,but this higher spec model has more functions/uses etc which he says are all excellent features.",5.0
I was a little concerned about connectivity when I read the reviews but it set up in minutes and have downloaded Alexa and Spotify with ease and both are working well. I stepped up to a versa from my old Fitbit and the stats are all pretty much the same apart from you can choose many more watch faces and exercises. I’m very pleased with it so far!,5.0
Great value and good features for the price,5.0
"Great watch, not 100% accurate but unfortunately I seem to be allergic to the casing it would appear that this is quite common from the Fitbit website.",4.0
Excellent fit bit but my only grievance is having to charge the battery every 2 days. My last fitbit lasted at least 4 days,5.0
Love my Fitbit and thank you amazon for the competitive price. Good for tracking basic health with options for more advanced tracking. Great to be able to control music in shower and wear in the pool with confidence.,5.0
"Awful watch, first one broke, sent back got sent a new one, had to have a different colour due to no stock, second one came after a week step counted stops working completely deletes steps, doesn't recognise sleep accurately, is dreadful avoid buying",1.0
"The app is not so much intuitive but if you really looking for something you will find. I think that it's a good smartwatch but if you are just looking for a sleeping tracking, heart hate and daily step, go to Xiaomi Mi Band 4 (It's cheaper than FitBit  and I already had and I bought FitBit versa 2 for a upgrade).",4.0
Cannot connect via WiFi - connects then immediately disconnects. Sleep tracking only works once or twice a week. Gave up talking to Fitbit customer services as couldn’t resolve issues. Good for logging exercise.,3.0
I live on my own and I can turn my hand to most things but when I recurved my watch it was and still is very complicated to set up and I am very sad because it cost me a lot of money to buy it as I’ve always wanted a smart watch.I have a good mind to send it back,1.0
I had the first fit bit and enjoyed it for a few years ... I decided to upgrade to the Fitbit versa two ..whilst it has a lot more features and looks nice and stylish the battery life is poor I have to charge it every two days other than that it is fine would I purchase it again .... No,3.0
So happy with this purchase! So many people have asked if it was an Apple Watch! Love tracking my fitness and all the other features!,5.0
"Really pleased with this, does everything I wanted really well, definitely helps with staying fit. The Amazon's exclusive colour is a stylish bonus.",5.0
This is a feature packed product. Upgraded from previous in a very thoughtful way. Great Battery life and problem free.,5.0
"It's pretty, it has hundreds of nice watch faces to chose from, it does what it says it does, however setup takes more than 2 hours over any network, it never ever synchronizes data even with correct settings to do so. Connectivity is defenitly an issue, it makes the watch worthless. Don't buy.",1.0
"I love this fitbit, it was an upgrade from a fitbit Blaze for me and it works very well and very easy to use.",5.0
"Good smart watch. Has basic features such as weather, alarms, stopwatch and amazon alexa commands. Calorie tracking is quite accurate. However, the app for the fitbit isn't very good at all. Overall, I gave the watch a 4 star it looks nice and functions as it should, the biggest drawback is the app. I highly recommend this product if you're i  to fitness.",4.0
Honestly one of the best devices I have purchased in a long long time. One could argue that the calorie counter and step count is slightly inaccurate but this is better than the others by a mile. I have lost two stones and since a 2 month ago purchase I am not sick of it yet. Great price at the time and all. Thanks fitbit!!,5.0
Very good fitness watch looks good and battery life is good about 4 days . App is good covers virtually everything you need. Would recommend.,5.0
trouble shouted from the beginning onwards!. seems quality issues are the main reason. now it is completely dead,3.0
Awful product - don't buy.Notifications rarley work unless you dont mind uninstalling and reinstalling the app daily and it's super inaccurate for runs. I do the same route quite often and fitbit has been out by up to 25%.,1.0
"Perfect smart watch. Great for steps, notifications. Very good motivator.  User friendly than Apple Watch to me.",5.0
"Love the sleep tracking, Alexa app , the calls you can receive when no signal and your on WiFi & Bluetooth",5.0
At last I have found a Fitbit which actually is easy to read in the sunlight. It is easy to use and great as a tracker. I also like the way I can change its appearance by changing the accessories. Great buy for me.,5.0
Have had a small Alta Fitbit for a few years but wanted better functionality Bought a cheap version first. Big mistake!  Buy cheap buy twice. This is far superior and worth the money.,5.0
"Amazing gadgets on this fitbit. Battery life ok, sleep tracking and calories burned tracker is brilliant",5.0
"I bought the watch in July 2020 and since then till now it has never connected on my samsung galaxy phone. I have never gotten any notifications on the watch, I have restarted the phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still nothing. There are very significant connectivity pitfalls that need to be addressed. If I could return my watch I would.",1.0
I wear this watch all the time and I love tracking my steps. It pushes me to do more. I think this was a great price for a really nice watch!,5.0
Cannot fault this watch. All features work correctly - looks lovely and is comfortable to wear. Recommended.,5.0
"Once again a fitbit that has malfunctioned. Brilliant when working, but as with my fitbit Blaze which stopped working within a year and had to be replaced. The Versa 2 has done the same. So many people on line with the same issues. Very poor and at £199.99 a pop, very poor value. I'd rather have a refund than a replacement so I can by a better watch/different brand.",1.0
"Fairly easy to learn to use, though the apps and downloads have to be checked carefully as many have to be paid for",5.0
"Unable to link with app. Fitbit text support worse than useless. Sadly unable to use, had to return.",2.0
Bought it last year in July. Stopped working 3 times. Decided to return today. Don’t waste your money.,1.0
"Love this watch it’s awesome, however moving my music to it nightmare ( could possibly be operator error )",5.0
"I really like Fitbit and updated from the Fitbit HR to the Versa 2, however, the resin strap left me with a nasty reaction when doing physical exercise, a problem I never experienced with my previous Fitbit, so I was obliged to buy another strap.",5.0
I bought this Fitbit as the face was a lot bigger than my previous one. I am delighted with it.,5.0
"Best one I've had so far. Accurate, good free clock faces, can do most things from the watch itself. Great buy.",5.0
"Bought this as a Xmas present but when the box was opened there was no watch inside, just a charger and a strap. Ripped off as paid for the watch.",1.0
"Unfortunately I woke up today and the screen has gone completely blank, it’s fully charged but it’s now broken. Absolutely gutted as loved my watch and I’ve only had it since January! Charged when it needed it and kept away from water but still broke!? Upset and disappointed so wouldn’t recommend!",1.0
Love my Fitbit as it keeps me on track healthwise.  Love the style and battery life is good.,5.0
Shockingly bad battery. If you want to charge daily then this is for you. I am really disappointed at this version. Loved my first verses. Treated myself to a new one and so wish I hadn’t.,1.0
"Great, I upgraded from the charge 3.  It is similar but looks a lot more modern.  Very happy",5.0
What’s to say ! Dose everything it say on the tin 💯 and looks awesomeThey write there own reviews really !Always wanted one finally got one yay 😁I’m terrible with Technology but found this so easy to follow and set up which was my only concern in getting one I need not of worried !,5.0
Bought as present. Battery lasts one day. Sent for repair. Still broken. Amazon passes you to Fitbit and vice versa. (No pun intended) do not buy.,1.0
This worked for all of 5 weeks then stopped tracking and recording data. Amazon would do nothing except pass you over to fitbit for you sort out yourself. Awful value for the 150 pounds cost. I could understand if it was a year or so old but I contacted them after only two months from purchase. Will never purchase another fitbit or anything electrical from Amazon again.,1.0
"My second Fitbit wouldn’t be without it great finess watch, so easy to set up too thank you",5.0
Im excited to try this gadget since I received it. Just having hard time to navigate all the features especially with the music which the one Im after for. It can't play the music within the fitbit unless you have the headset on. Meaning I have to spend another money for a headset.,3.0
"Bought this for my boyfriend, he loves it keeps going on about everything it can do, so happy to have good present for him",5.0
"Upgraded from the Fitbit charge 2 and love the way the Versa 2 fits on my wrist, it’s less bulky. Love the extra exercise you can choose. Only negative is that I spent hours trying to figure out how to transfer music but eventually gave up",5.0
"All working well, good battery life, got it for my daughter, she is very pleased with it.",5.0
Brilliant help to keep track of what I am up to. I know some people find the alert vibrate a bit intrusive but I think its great to remind me to move helps me manage my mpbility.Think the Sleep Tracker is really good has helped me change my habits and know quality of my sleep. I had on idea what a Fitbit could do so its great!,5.0
Very nice and cool overall. But the strap tends to very easily get covered in dust and dirt.,4.0
This item was fine and did everything well but just after the years warranty has expired it’s stopped working completely I cant charge it and it’s completely dead now. I’m very disappointed,2.0
Bought this as a present for someone and they loved it. The smart watch does everything it says it does and more. The owner had a bit of trouble connecting to the app but Fitbit explained to her how to fix it and now it works perfectly.,5.0
Previously had Charge 2 which was good. Very happy with new Versa 2. Much lighter than I thought it would be. Works well and screen is much better - I can actually see the screen to be able to tell the time!! didn’t particularly like the strap but I always change mine for a magnetic metal strap anyway so it wasn’t an issue for me.,5.0
My Versa 2 locked up with an unfixable software error - a week after the last day for possible return to Amazon.Contacted the manufacturer who promised a replacement - I'm still waiting !!!,1.0
"This is my second versa 2 in the space of 17 months both had the same fault, as it was covered under warranty the first time and was repaired, however the second one is not covered, I absolutely love tracking all my exercise , sleep and steps with fit bit  but feel really let down by it’s ability to last longer than 8 months before breaking 👎🏼",1.0
"Bought this for my partner for his Birthday, He absolutely Loves it😊, he wont sleep or leave the house without it , it does everything as it says,👍  A PIECE OF MIND, if you want to keep a track of your health, 🏃‍♀️🕺🏋️‍♀️I will be buying 😊one for myself.",5.0

"I received it couple days ago and it was perfect, everything as expected, Amazon brilliant as always on delivery. But yesterday I had a problem with Alexa, she kept saying that there was no internet connection on my phone even though there was (I checked many times), just returned to Amazon.",3.0
"I had the Fitbit versa before my new versa 2 and there’s not much difference to be honest.  I just hope the screen on this one doesn’t stop working like it did on my other Fitbit versa. Love tracking my swimming, sleep and steps. Beware the calories burnt during workouts aren’t accurate but it’s still good to track your steps.",5.0
"This is my fourth FitBit. I thought I would treat myself. Very complicated to set up, and the wrist band brought me out in a rash so I have had to buy another. I am hoping to get up to speed with it soon. Hence only 4 stars.",4.0
Fantastic watch to motivate my fat ass! Lovely sleek watch that monitors all the relevant factors of my day. Has encouraged me to do better each day. Feels nice on the wrist and looks lovely. Connects to my phone smoothly and updates regularly.,5.0
"Love it, I never thought I would go for one of these having a high end mechanical watch. I was wrong.",5.0
"I had a charge 2 previously and decided to treat myself and get a versa and I absolutely love it! Battery is good and I have nothing bad to say about it so far, great product",5.0
"Absolute rubbish compared to my charge 2, only bought this as was supposed to support apps, doesn’t even send me text notifications let alone emails and I really bought it because of fitpay I have 4 uk bank accounts none are linked to fitpay!",1.0
If you use it as designed it keeps nagging you to attain your targets.  It's a pain but I like it,4.0
"2nd time round , as a upgrade, I’ve no problems with this watch so far, apart from battery life those not last more than 2days",5.0
Really like the this item. Great for keeping track of exercise etc. The only disappointment is that wishing you use it for contactless payments I find it does not accept cards from my bank! in fact there was only one UK bank listed that I recognised so beware if it is a feature you wish to may use of.,3.0
"Was a present for my mother, she loved it. Not sure if she’s used it yet though!",5.0
"I loved the look & colour of this, the app is easy to navigate around, however I was really disappointed that the step tracker counted arm movement as steps! I cleaned my windows at home and it looked like I’d walked a marathon! I hoped for more from a fitness tracker costing £200.",3.0
"Another great Fitbit tracker, does everything it says. Works well with app too",5.0
Have had fitbits before and although there is not much different with the app I love the new one as I can read the time without my glasses. It’s very stylish too.,5.0
"Perfect for exercising it tracks really well. The reason it's not 5 stars is that you can wear it all night as it started giving me a red mark on my hand which I thought was not great for my skin, so I haven't been able to sleep track however overall it has been perfect for everything else.",4.0
"I thought I would love this Fitbit I just like it, the battery life is absolutely ridiculous had it on full battery one day and the next day it’s dead. The mobile app isn’t as good as before mine constantly has issues with syncing the watch and don’t think it actually counts steps properly.",4.0
"Update from my last fitbit ,it is very stylish clearer and longer battery life",5.0
It does disconnect from my notifications at times but enjoying the added features,5.0
Nice looking watch that offers more than its predecessors.My issue is the heart rate monitor keeps dropping off so it’s not recording my workouts correctly. Tried resetting and Fitbit support. Neither have resolved the issue.,2.0
"On the whole I am happy with the watch , though am unable to get music , keeps saying its not compatible  , anyone got advice.",2.0
Nice sleek look with cool features.Downside is it doesn’t work on my tattooed wrist (previous Fitbit Charge 3 did 🤔) but does on my tattoo free wrist. Thought this couldn’t be the case but went on some forums and found others had same issue. Weird but I’ve managed to live with it..,4.0
"Love everything about this watch, it's really pretty, the battery life is amazing and so are all the features, wish I'd bought one a lot sooner",5.0
"Ok now but had to return as the item did not work. However, good support from Fitbit and new watch sent within five days.good",3.0
"Returned to amazon, step tracker inaccurate even after calibration. Faff to set up, took ages as kept losing bluetooth signal to my S10. Very disappointed, have gone back to my 20 quid imitation fitbit!",3.0
Best avoid this model. Its super time consuming and complicated to use. The battery life is dire.Possibly the worst purchase I've ever made.,1.0
This was a present bought for me to replace my old fitbit. I love the clear face and features. This Fitbit has just about every type of exercise you could need plus other useful apps.,5.0
First one only lasted a month . Amazon changed it no bother. See how long this one lasts,5.0
"Great item easy to use, comfortable to wear and does everything it is meant to do!",5.0
"It seemed to work fine for a few weeks but ive had nothing but problems with it since. It won't track or save workouts on the watch or on the app, it doesn't track sleep properly, it doesn't sync properly and kicks me off the app a lot too. Very unhappy with it waste of money it doesn't do anything it's supposed to",1.0
Only really use it for steps and checking my messsges...absolutely love it,5.0
"Great Fitbit comes with so much relax, workout, pay from your Fitbit, Alexa, you can change your watch face and so much more.",5.0
I love this watch the strap is soft and the watch face is clear and bright,5.0
Nice looking. Bit more feminine looking than the Ionic. Does a decent job of tracking steps and distance,5.0
Do not buy if you are heavily tattooed. This watch will not track your heart rate or sleep if you are heavily tattooed. The customer service advice was wear it on your ankle. Yes so I can look like I’m on tag.... no.,1.0
Wife loves as she can now keep an eye on what she is doing to keep fit.,5.0
Very light weight and simple to use. Not had it long but impressed so far. Shame it’s not full smart watch so you can’t answer calls and send messages but everything else seems to work well.,5.0
Really good Fitbit - logs sleep and exercise well. Great apps on watch. Good battery life.,5.0
"The software on this watch is VERY VERY glitchy and hard to use.I had a Fitbit Charge 2 which finally broke after 2 years of being battered and bought this as what I thought was an upgrade. Sadly not.Stay simple and just get another charge 2, I wish I had",1.0
Great for helping me get on track with my health and fitness. The colour is lovely too.,5.0

Bought for my Mum she loves it and is now obsessed with all the apps,5.0
Great when it works. Not so great when it malfunctions mid-run and you lose all of your sweet Strava data. I bought this in January and by July it’s already unusable. Buy a Garmin!,2.0
"Bought as a presant ,but was told it is really good fitness watch.",5.0
Bought as a replacement product. Does exactly what is say. Very smart product. Looks like the other more expensive product but at a fraction of the cost and has many similar features. Excellent product.,5.0
"It has taken my husband a little while to get used it this, he used to have a Fitbit surge. Seems to like it though.",5.0
"Brilliant item. Doing million step challenge for diabetes UK & my versa 2 had kept me going, reminding me when need to do more steps etc. The sleep mode has helped me with get my sleep pattern better",5.0

Purchased as a gift but the recipient loved everything about it.,5.0
"My third watch Fitbit ,response quicker than the Fitbit versa,easier to use, one button instead of 3",5.0
"No longer at the gym but this keeps me motivated - logs my 10,000 steps each day, diet, water and weight as well as quality of sleep.  Just a nudge in the right direction every day along with Joe Wicks.  I also love the colour and graphics.",5.0
Great item. Bought for my sister.. only thing is that it scratches quite easy compared to the versa 1 which I have.Lots of features handyA great item,4.0
"2 fitbits in, my heart rate is still around 50bpm off.I do vigorous exercise and my chest monitor records 160bpm, whereas this one shows 100-110. It's only good for step tracking but to be honest a £20 smart watch can do that.Utterly useless, avoid at all costs.",1.0
"Would not recommend this product. Bought it for my wife and less than twelve months later it's packed up! All that's displayed is the Fitbit startup logo on the face. Having checked online for a solution, it would appear that this is one of a few problems with this product.  Avoid!!!!!",1.0
"Good value if bought at reduced price.  Better than my previous Versa Lite, if only because of improved battery life.  Would be even better if extras were provided free.",5.0
"Doesn't connect to p30. Spoke to fit bit who are aware of the issue... Told last November they were “working on it ""Waste of time as majority relies on phone connection!!!!",2.0

"Bought for my sons birthday, and we're big Fitbit fans. Wife and I both have them, and now my son does too.",5.0
Nice looking watch with good features but the biggest let down for me is the distance when not tracking through GPS. The whole point of me getting a watch to track my running was so I didn't need to bring my phone but I need to bring my phone with me or else the GPS distance and my pace will be completely off.,2.0
Quick Delivery... was bought as a gift and my partner loves it!!,5.0
"The battery needs charging every 2 to 3 days, pain in the bum, but love the watch itself",5.0
Really liked the watch but it's Bluetooth is useless. Won't update on the app with my phone and have had to delete it 3 times in a month meaning it wipes my data. Worse connectivity than my old blaze. Sadly I think I will have to return this and not sure I will get a replacement.,2.0
I've had the fitbit versa 2 for less than a month and it has completely died. It turned off with a 70% battery and hasn't turned on since. I have followed all troubleshooting guidance to no avail. After looking online it appears a number of people have had the same issue. Avoid.,1.0
"Does what it's meant to do, set up is a bit complex, can't link emails to it yet but getting there bit at time",5.0
"A good upgrade from my Fitbit blaze. Sadly I can't use fitbit pay for my bank as in the UK, it doesnt' support more than a couple of banks.",5.0

"Dear Sir/Madam,I have recently purchased a Fitbit Versa 2 from you (22nd January 2021) and I’m disappointed to say that the device has stopped working already. The watch has been fully charged and it does not turn on. For a brand new device to stop working after 3 month is frankly shocking.",1.0
Lovely watch and great for keeping track of sleep and heart rate,5.0
The only shortcoming is that the strap appears to have been assembled incorrectly and therefore appears to be inside out.,5.0
I didn’t like the button on the left of  the  Fitbit and could do with some different free watchfacesI like the  apps and  let you know how many steps left at the hour to achieve your goalsI like the shape of the watche,3.0

I would have rated it high if it hadn't of packed up after less than four months of ownership.  The battery life could be better as my charge 3 lasted a week.,1.0

"I had my fitbit sent for repair through amazon and since ive had it back its been glitching, not charging properly and has not completely switched off. I originally had a rose gold which they replaced with a black one and im so annoyed as i use my fitbit constantly. Not happy.",1.0
"I went for the Versa2 because of the 5 day battery life feature, but I am lucky to get 2/3 days of charge which is really annoying, since this is the main feature of going for the original versa vs versa2, I am not sure it is worth the extra money.",2.0
"Don't bother with cheap versions, this is the best by far. App very good, notifications excellent, does deliver all it promises.",5.0
Nice unit overall but could be so much better for the money. Alexa loses connection and doesn't work 90% of the time. Does hold its charge for 5 days though. I've had 2 of these replaced and am already on my third due to unfixable software issues. Notifications work well.,4.0

Excellent quality gave to Grandson for Christmas,5.0
It is a very good product and I used it for months but after an iPhone 6 being thrown at it it broke the screen. Another thing I dislike about it is the fact you can’t answer calls on it .you can answer them but it takes it straight to your phone,4.0
All will be fine unless you need to contact support. They're useless. Maybe 50 emails later I'm still waiting on getting my fitbit replaced. Probably better getting an Apple Watch in hindsight.,1.0

I've been using the watch for 5-6 weeks. The battery dies in two days. I've never used it without charging for 4 days. The rose gold plating on aluminium parts started to be peeled off. You need to buy premium to be able to use lots of tools and apps.,4.0

"I love my Fitbit, BUT, beware of the band!  I wear my watch so it doesn't move around.  I went Swing Dancing and came home and took a shower and found what looked like chemical burns.  I read all the information and this is a known problem!  The band doesnt breathe and bacteria forms in minutes.  The first is the burn from Saturday.  The second was from a 20 minute dog walk and I cleaned my arm and the band immediately.  Their fix... take it off.  Well what did I spend 200.00 on to not wear it.The Fitbit is an amazing fitness device.  I have used the Garmin and the Samsung and went back to the Fitbit.  Just buy the breathable replacement band!",4.0

"This is my 3rd FitBit, I pre-ordered the Versa 2 with Alexa as soon as I heard about it as my Ionic had just died after nearly 2 years. I tried an Apple Watch but switched back for a few reasons. One, the battery life on Fitbit beats Apple by a landslide, Apple has to be charged daily, my V2 is a year old and still lasts 4+ days. And it charges crazy fast! Two, I love my community on FitBit. Weekly challenges with people I know from all over the world, family, old friends & new friends. It’s a neat way to stay connected without all the social media crap.As mentioned, this one is a year old now, it still works great, the watch face is in great condition (a few minor scratches, I’m hard on all my devices and wear my FitBit 24/7), it has lots of great features  and apps. The sleep score is very helpful, sometimes it stops working properly (it glitches on avg 2-3 months) but all that is needed is a reboot of the watch itself.For me personally, I should have ordered the one without Alexa and saved a few dollars as I never use that feature, despite having plenty of Alexa devices around the house. But this in no way diminishes the quality and Alexa is something you would use a lot, def go for it, it works just fine, I just don’t really like talking to my watch (I guess I’ll never work for CONTROL 😉).The app itself is good, I’d make some changes but nothing major.",5.0
Really nice on and very comfortable. The app seems to be really accurate and the watch itself is great at notifying you!,5.0

"I like the design a lot. Auto recognize for the exercise 'walk' works fine. 'Bike' not so much. Battery life is 4-5 days. Sleep tracking is reliable as far as I can tell. It's my first ever smartwatch/fitness tracker so I don't have anything to compare it to. I can only give 3 stars though because elliptical is my main exercise and the versa 2 is supposed to recognize me doing that with my hands on the bars. It doesn't! Even if I start the exercise manually on the device the heart rate sensor is unreliable. AND: it doesn't even count my steps  correctly with my hands on the bars (so how is it gonna recognize the exercise...) It counts about 2,000-2,500 steps an hour with hands on bars while I really take between 6 and 7k. I'm very disappointed about that. Also I read that it doesn't measure my heart rate while swimming so I wonder how it's supposed to tell me how many calories I burnt... I haven't had the chance to try that yet though because of lockdown... I'm gonna keep the watch and hope that maybe some updates can fix the problems. But if that doesn't happen soon I'm gonna return it!",3.0
"Wish it was a better watch. Switching from blaze.. So I'm familiar to the fitbit app, for some reasons it doesn't sync well. The steps count was so off. I thought it would track laps on watch, but apparently they changed and versa don't do that anymore.Nevertheless on the app, it tells you the laps, distance, time.. but again was not 100 % accurate... I'm used to count manually, over 1km.  Had to return.",1.0
"The actual device is awesome, but found that it is awful for allowing notifications to appear on phone. I have to constantly delete app on phone and re-install it.. for notifications to work. Also to have fitbit sync, you have to mess around with app multiple times.",4.0
"I am loving my new Fitbit, its sleek and compact.Perfect for all different types of workouts.Step count is accurate however I don't believe the calorie tracker is accurate.Alexa is a nice touch especially if you have other Alexa compatible devices.The Fitbit app is user friendly and has fun challenges for you and your friends.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase (even got one for my dad).",5.0
"I've only had it a few days and it's already been the perfect thing to buy.No complaints at all, of course other than the price.  Helps monitor my healthwhich is extremely important to me.  Terrific buy for anyone.",5.0
"I needed a cheaper watch to walk to dog in and now I don't take it off...check my stats every morning and am more interested in my sleep than I have ever been in my life... I have always been active, so it hasn't increased my activity levels just made me more aware of them. I think for someone wanting to get fitter this watch my might be a good motivator.",5.0
"This is classic fittnes tracker watch. Mobile app is a litle bit too complicated, but still useful. Could improve compatibility with some important apps, it is not intended to be used as real smartwatch.",5.0
"Was originally going to return because of price drop, but kept it...Bought as a gift for my Mom mainly for her to correct her sleep pattern and to increase her walking.... unfortunately during the nite the watch light keeps turning on and not only interrupting but my Fathers as well.. called Fitbit to correct problem but was not resolved..so returning",5.0
I wasn't that empressed by the display ..Seemed like a Toy or somethingbut lately i developed an allergic dermtitis on my had along the place of the strip .. im deeply sad about it actually and i can't use the watch in the mean time .,2.0
"Love the color, material is good, fits great and decent price.I dislike that you need to buy a premium membership to get detailed sleep tracking, and that the count is a bit off for the actual steps talen.",5.0
Bought for my wife she loves it. Gets great use out of it for all her fitness needs. Fantastic app and in watch functions,5.0
Really enjoying this watch. Its a nice size and motivating to get you moving. The app is easy to use. Logging your food keeps me accountable and sleep tracker is fun as a glimpse of sleep cycles. This is my first smart watch and im very happy with this purchase.,5.0
I have a big disappointed because my versa 2 stopped and didn't work again I bought it before just three months 😳 ... Anyone can help me what can I do? I sent emails for amazon but I haven't any answers I'm in greece and I ordered from amazon.de !! ! I need to fix my watch problem and I don't have any fitbit service office here in greece please helppppppp,1.0
"Very nice stile, simple to use and conect to your phone. The apps included are useful I'd you are into sports. I run with stroller and even if I don't move the wrist it counts the steps. I love it!",5.0
"Works very well overall. Great to track steps, workouts and sleep. Timer and Alarm function is very convenient. Its a bit tricky to connect the spotify app, but once that works ita very convenient to manage your playlist from your wrist.",5.0

"Same problem as years ago, had to switch the watch from one hand the other, the rashes got so bad. Cannot recommend this product until the problem is addressed",1.0
"It's definitely worth the upgrade from Fitbit Inspired HR. Bigger and brighter screen even in sunlight. More apps like calculator, currency exchange, notes come in handy. And battery can last longer. No to forget Fitbit pay, useful for Train, bus ride.",5.0
"When I first bought this Fitbit it was great. However, 4 months later it has completely stopped working. It will not charge turn on or even sync. I am completely dissatisfied and will not ever purchase again.",5.0
"Display perfect.Battery lasts about 5 days.Steps meter cannot say much, but it looks that it over calculate a little bit.Display on demand (once you turn your wrist) - is not perfect yet, but I still testing some setup.General - everything is good enough for me.",4.0
I have only just started to use the functions mainly the heartbeat and steps but am looking forward to expanding my use of this Fitbit I’m very pleased about the battery life between charging,5.0
